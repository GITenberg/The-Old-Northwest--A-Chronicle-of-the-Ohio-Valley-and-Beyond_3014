    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> fall of Montreal, on September 8, 1760, 
			while the plains about the city were still dotted with the white tents of 
			the victorious English and colonial troops, was indeed an event of the 
			deepest consequence to America and to the world. By the articles of 
			capitulation which were signed by the Marquis de Vaudreuil, Governor of 
			New France, Canada and all its dependencies westward to the Mississippi 
			passed to the British Crown. Virtually ended was the long struggle for the 
			dominion of the New World. Open now for English occupation and settlement 
			was that vast country lying south of the Great Lakes between the Ohio and 
			the Mississippi&mdash;which we know as the Old Northwest&mdash;today 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_002" id="Page_002">2</a></span>
			the seat of five great commonwealths of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an ingenuity born of necessity, the French pathfinders and colonizers
      of the Old Northwest had chosen for their settlements sites which would
      serve at once the purposes of the priest, the trader, and the soldier; and
      with scarcely an exception these sites are as important today as when they
      were first selected. Four regions, chiefly, were still occupied by the
      French at the time of the capitulation of Montreal. The most important, as
      well as the most distant, of these regions was on the east bank of the
      Mississippi, opposite and below the present city of St. Louis, where a
      cluster of missions, forts, and trading-posts held the center of the
      tenuous line extending from Canada to Louisiana. A second was the Illinois
      country, centering about the citadel of St. Louis which La Salle had
      erected in 1682 on the summit of "Starved Rock," near the modern town of
      Ottawa in Illinois. A third was the valley of the Wabash, where in the
      early years of the eighteenth century Vincennes had become the seat of a
      colony commanding both the Wabash and the lower Ohio. And the fourth was
      the western end of Lake Erie, where Detroit, founded by the doughty
      Cadillac in 1701, had assumed 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_003" id="Page_003">3</a></span>
			such strength that for fifty years it had discouraged the ambitions of 
			the English to make the Northwest theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Jeffrey Amherst, to whom Vaudreuil surrendered in 1760, forthwith
      dispatched to the western country a military force to take possession of
      the posts still remaining in the hands of the French. The mission was
      entrusted to a stalwart New Hampshire Scotch-Irishman, Major Robert
      Rogers, who as leader of a band of intrepid "rangers" had made himself the
      hero of the northern frontier. Two hundred men were chosen for the
      undertaking, and on the 13th of September the party, in fifteen
      whaleboats, started up the St. Lawrence for Detroit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, near the site of the present city of
      Cleveland, the travelers were halted by a band of Indian chiefs and
      warriors who, in the name of their great ruler Pontiac, demanded to know
      the object of their journeying. Parleys followed, in which Pontiac himself
      took part, and it was explained that the French had surrendered Canada to
      the English and that the English merely proposed to assume control of the
      western posts, with a view to friendly relations between the red men and
      the white men. The rivers, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_004" id="Page_004">4</a></span>
			it was promised, would flow with rum, and presents from the great King 
			would be forthcoming in endless profusion. The explanation seemed to 
			satisfy the savages, and, after smoking the calumet with due ceremony, 
			the chieftain and his followers withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in November, Rogers and his men in their whaleboats appeared before
      the little palisaded town of Detroit. They found the French commander,
      Bel&ecirc;tre, in surly humor and seeking to stir up the neighboring 
			Wyandots and Potawatomi against them. But the attempt failed, and there 
			was nothing for Bel&ecirc;tre to do but yield. The French soldiery marched 
			out of the fort, laid down their arms, and were sent off as prisoners 
			down the river. The fleur-de-lis, which for more than half a century had 
			floated over the village, was hauled down, and, to the accompaniment of 
			cheers, the British ensign was run up. The red men looked on with 
			amazement at this display of English authority and marveled how the 
			conquerors forbore to slay their vanquished enemies on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detroit in 1760 was a picturesque, lively, and rapidly growing frontier
      town. The central portions of the settlement, lying within the bounds of
      the present city, contained ninety or a hundred 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_005" id="Page_005">5</a></span>
			small houses, chiefly of wood and roofed with bark or thatch. A well-built 
			range of barracks afforded quarters for the soldiery, and there were two 
			public buildings&mdash;a council house and a little church. The whole was 
			surrounded by a square palisade twenty-five feet high, with a wooden 
			bastion at each corner and a blockhouse over each gateway. A broad 
			passageway, the <i>chemin du ronde,</i> lay next to the palisade, and on 
			little narrow streets at the center the houses were grouped closely 
			together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above and below the fort the banks of the river were lined on both sides,
      for a distance of eight or nine miles, with little rectangular farms, so
      laid out as to give each a water-landing. On each farm was a cottage, with
      a garden and orchard, surrounded by a fence of rounded pickets; and the
      countryside rang with the shouts and laughter of a prosperous and happy
      peasantry. Within the limits of the settlement were villages of Ottawas,
      Potawatomi, and Wyandots, with whose inhabitants the French lived on free
      and easy terms. "The joyous sparkling of the bright blue water," writes
      Parkman; "the green luxuriance of the woods; the white dwellings, looking
      out from the foliage; and in the distance the Indian wigwams curling their
      smoke 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_006" id="Page_006">6</a></span>
			against the sky&mdash;all were mingled in one broad scene of wild
      and rural beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the coming of the English the French residents were given an
      opportunity to withdraw. Few, however, did so, and from the gossipy
      correspondence of the pleasure-loving Colonel Campbell, who for some
      months was left in command of the fort, it appears that the life of the
      place lost none of its gayety by the change of masters. Sunday card
      parties at the quarters of the commandant were festive affairs; and at a
      ball held in celebration of the King's birthday the ladies presented an
      appearance so splendid as to call forth from the impressionable officer
      the most extravagant praises. A visit in the summer of 1761 from Sir
      William Johnson, general supervisor of Indian affairs on the frontier,
      became the greatest social event in the history of the settlement, if not
      of the entire West. Colonel Campbell gave a ball at which the guests
      danced nine hours. Sir William reciprocated with one at which they danced
      eleven hours. A round of dinners and calls gave opportunity for much
      display of frontier magnificence, as well as for the consumption of
      astonishing quantities of wines and cordials. Hundreds of Indians were
      interested spectators, and the gifts with which they were generously
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_007" id="Page_007">7</a></span>
      showered were received with evidences of deep satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      No amount of fiddling and dancing, however, could quite drown apprehension
      concerning the safety of the post and the security of the English hold
      upon the great region over which this fort and its distant neighbors stood
      sentinel. Thousands of square miles of territory were committed to the
      keeping of not more than six hundred soldiers. From the French there was
      little danger. But from the Indians anything might be expected. Apart from
      the Iroquois, the red men had been bound to the French by many ties of
      friendship and common interest, and in the late war they had scalped and
      slaughtered and burned unhesitatingly at the French command. Hardly,
      indeed, had the transfer of territorial sovereignty been made before
      murmurs of discontent began to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding outward expressions of assent to the new order of things,
      a deep-rooted dislike on the part of the Indians for the English grew
      after 1760 with great rapidity. They sorely missed the gifts and supplies
      lavishly provided by the French, and they warmly resented the rapacity and
      arrogance of the British traders. The open contempt of the soldiery at the
      posts galled the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_008" id="Page_008">8</a></span>
			Indians, and the confiscation of their lands drove them
      to desperation. In their hearts hope never died that the French would
      regain their lost dominion; and again and again rumors were set afloat
      that this was about to happen. The belief in such a reconquest was
      adroitly encouraged, too, by the surviving French settlers and traders. In
      1761 the tension among the Indians was increased by the appearance of a
      "prophet" among the Delawares, calling on all his race to purge itself of
      foreign influences and to unite to drive the white man from the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protests against English encroachments were frequent and, though
      respectful, none the less emphatic. At a conference in Philadelphia in
      1761, an Iroquois sachem declared, "We, your Brethren, of the several
      Nations, are penned up like Hoggs. There are Forts all around us, and
      therefore we are apprehensive that Death is coming upon us." "We are now
      left in Peace," ran a petition of some Christian Oneidas addressed to Sir
      William Johnson, "and have nothing to do but to plant our Corn, Hunt the
      wild Beasts, smoke our Pipes, and mind Religion. But as these Forts, which
      are built among us, disturb our Peace, and are a great hurt to Religion,
      because some of our Warriors are 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_009" id="Page_009">9</a></span>
			foolish, and some of our Brother Soldiers don't fear God, we therefore 
			desire that these Forts may be pull'd down, and kick'd out of the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The leadership of the great revolt that was impending fell naturally upon
      Pontiac, who, since the coming of the English, had established himself
      with his squaws and children on a wooded island in Lake St. Clair, barely
      out of view of the fortifications of Detroit. In all Indian annals no name
      is more illustrious than Pontiac's; no figure more forcefully displays the
      good and bad qualities of his race. Principal chief of the Ottawa tribe,
      he was also by 1763 the head of a powerful confederation of Ottawas,
      Ojibwas, and Potawatomi, and a leader known and respected among Algonquin
      peoples from the sources of the Ohio to the Mississippi. While capable of
      acts of magnanimity, he had an ambition of Napoleonic proportions, and to
      attain his ends he was prepared to use any means. More clearly than most
      of his forest contemporaries, he perceived that in the life of the Indian
      people a crisis had come. He saw that, unless the tide of English invasion
      was rolled back at once, all would be lost. The colonial farmers would
      push in after the soldiers; the forests would be cut away; the
      hunting-grounds would be destroyed; 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_010" id="Page_010">10</a></span>
			the native population would be driven away or enslaved. In the silence of 
			his wigwam he thought out a plan of action, and by the closing weeks of 
			1762 he was ready. Never was plot more shrewdly devised and more artfully 
			carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the winter of 1762-63 his messengers passed stealthily from nation
      to nation throughout the whole western country, bearing the pictured
      wampum belts and the reddened tomahawks which symbolized war; and in
      April, 1763, the Lake tribes were summoned to a great council on the banks
      of the Ecorces, below Detroit, where Pontiac in person proclaimed the will
      of the Master of Life as revealed to the Delaware prophet, and then
      announced the details of his plan. Everywhere the appeal met with
      approval; and not only the scores of Algonquin peoples, but also the
      Seneca branch of the Iroquois confederacy and a number of tribes on the
      lower Mississippi, pledged themselves with all solemnity to fulfill their
      prophet's injunction "to drive the dogs which wear red clothing into the
      sea." While keen-eyed warriors sought to keep up appearances by lounging
      about the forts and begging in their customary manner for tobacco,
      whiskey, and gunpowder, every wigwam and forest hamlet from Niagara to the
      Mississippi 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_011" id="Page_011">11</a></span>
			was astir. Dusky maidens chanted the tribal war-songs, and in the blaze of 
			a hundred camp-fires chiefs and warriors performed the savage pantomime of 
			battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simultaneous attack, timed by a change of the moon, was to be made on
      the English forts and settlements throughout all the western country.
      Every tribe was to fall upon the settlement nearest at hand, and
      afterwards all were to combine&mdash;with French aid, it was confidently
      believed&mdash;in an assault on the seats of English power farther east.
      The honor of destroying the most important of the English strongholds,
      Detroit, was reserved for Pontiac himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The date fixed for the rising was the 7th of May. Six days in advance
      Pontiac with forty of his warriors appeared at the fort, protested undying
      friendship for the Great Father across the water, and insisted on
      performing the calumet dance before the new commandant, Major Gladwyn.
      This aroused no suspicion. But four days later a French settler reported
      that his wife, when visiting the Ottawa village to buy venison, had
      observed the men busily filing off the ends of their gunbarrels; and the
      blacksmith at the post recalled the fact that the Indians had lately
      sought to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012">12</a></span>
			borrow files and saws without being able to give a plausible
      explanation of the use they intended to make of the implements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English traveler Jonathan Carver, who visited the post five years
      afterwards, relates that an Ottawa girl with whom Major Gladwyn had formed
      an attachment betrayed the plot. Though this story is of doubtful
      authenticity, there is no doubt that, in one way or another, the
      commandant was amply warned that treachery was in the air. The sounds of
      revelry from the Indian camps, the furtive glances of the redskins
      lounging about the settlement, the very tension of the atmosphere, would
      have been enough to put an experienced Indian fighter on his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly when, on the fated morning, Pontiac and sixty redskins,
      carrying under long blankets their shortened muskets, appeared before the
      fort and asked admission, they were taken aback to find the whole garrison
      under arms. On their way from the gate to the council house they were
      obliged to march literally between rows of glittering steel. Well might
      even Pontiac falter. With uneasy glances, the party crowded into the
      council room, where Gladwyn and his officers sat waiting. "Why," asked the
      chieftain stolidly, "do I see so 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_013" id="Page_013">13</a></span>
			many of my father's young men standing in the street with their guns?" 
			"To keep them in training," was the laconic reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene that was planned was then carried out, except in one vital
      particular. When, in the course of his speech professing strong attachment
      to the English, the chieftain came to the point where he was to give the
      signal for slaughter by holding forth the wampum belt of peace inverted,
      he presented the emblem&mdash;to the accompaniment of a significant clash
      of arms and roll of drums from the mustered garrison outside&mdash;in the
      normal manner; and after a solemn warning from the commandant that
      vengeance would follow any act of aggression, the council broke up. To the
      forest leader's equivocal announcement that he would bring all of his
      wives and children in a few days to shake hands with their English
      fathers, Gladwyn deigned no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balked in his plans, the chief retired, but only to meditate fresh
      treachery; and when, a few days later, with a multitude of followers, he
      sought admission to the fort to assure "his fathers" that "evil birds had
      sung lies in their ears," and was refused, he called all his forces to
      arms, threw off his disguises, and began hostilities. For six months 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_014" id="Page_014">14</a></span>
			the settlement was besieged with a persistence rarely displayed in Indian
      warfare. At first the French inhabitants encouraged the besiegers, but,
      after it became known that a final peace between England and France had
      been concluded, they withheld further aid. Throughout the whole period,
      the English obtained supplies with no great difficulty from the
      neighboring farms. There was little actual fighting, and the loss of life
      was insignificant.
    </p>
    <p>
      By order of General Amherst, the French commander still in charge of Fort
      Chartres sent a messenger to inform the redskins definitely that no
      assistance from France would be forthcoming. "Forget then, my dear
      children,"&mdash;so ran the admonition&mdash;"all evil talks. Leave off
      from spilling the blood of your brethren, the English. Our hearts are now
      but one; you cannot, at present, strike the one without having the other
      for an enemy also." The effect was, as intended, to break the spirit of
      the besiegers; and in October Pontiac humbly sued for peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile a reign of terror spread over the entire frontier. Settlements
      from Forts Le B&oelig;uf and Venango, south of Lake Erie, to Green Bay, 
			west of Lake Michigan, were attacked, and ruses 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_015" id="Page_015">15</a></span>
			similar to that attempted at Detroit were generally successful. A few 
			Indians in friendly guise would approach a fort. After these were 
			admitted, others would appear, as if quite by chance. Finally, when 
			numbers were sufficient, the conspirators would draw their concealed 
			weapons, strike down the garrison, and begin a general massacre of the 
			helpless populace. Scores of pioneer families, scattered through the 
			wilderness, were murdered and scalped; traders were waylaid in the forest 
			solitudes; border towns were burned and plantations were devastated. In 
			the Ohio Valley everything was lost except Fort Pitt, formerly Fort 
			Duquesne; in the Northwest, everything was taken except Detroit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fort Pitt was repeatedly endangered, and the most important engagement of
      the war was fought in its defense. The relief of the post was entrusted in
      midsummer to a force of five hundred regulars lately transferred from the
      West Indies to Pennsylvania and placed under the command of Colonel Henry
      Bouquet. The expedition advanced with all possible caution, but early in
      August, 1764, when it was yet twenty-five miles from its destination, it
      was set upon by a formidable Indian band at Bushy Run and threatened with
      a fate not unlike 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_016" id="Page_016">16</a></span>
			that suffered by Braddock's little army in the same region nine years 
			earlier. Finding the woods full of redskins and all retreat cut off, the 
			troops, drawn up in a circle around their horses and supplies, fired with 
			such effect as they could upon the shadowy forms in the forest. No water 
			was obtainable, and in a few hours thirst began to make the soldiery 
			unmanageable. Realizing that the situation was desperate, Bouquet resorted 
			to a ruse by ordering his men to fall back as if in retreat. The trick 
			succeeded, and with yells of victory the Indians rushed from cover to 
			seize the coveted provisions&mdash;only to be met by a deadly fire and 
			put to utter rout. The news of the battle of Bushy Run spread rapidly 
			through the frontier regions and proved very effective in discouraging 
			further hostilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Bouquet's intention to press forward at once from Fort Pitt into
      the disturbed Ohio country. His losses, however, compelled the
      postponement of this part of the undertaking until the following year.
      Before he started off again he built at Fort Pitt a blockhouse which still
      stands, and which has been preserved for posterity by becoming, in 1894,
      the property of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Daughters of the American
      Revolution. In 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_017" id="Page_017">17</a></span>
			October, 1764, he set out for the Muskingum valley with a force of 
			fifteen hundred regulars, Pennsylvania and Virginia volunteers,
      and friendly Indians. By this time the great conspiracy was in collapse,
      and it was a matter of no great difficulty for Bouquet to enter into
      friendly relations with the successive tribes, to obtain treaties with
      them, and to procure the release of such English captives as were still in
      their hands. By the close of November, 1764, the work was complete, and
      Bouquet was back at Fort Pitt. Pennsylvania and Virginia honored him with
      votes of thanks; the King formally expressed his gratitude and tendered
      him the military governorship of the newly acquired territory of Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general pacification of the Northwest was accomplished by treaties
      with the natives in great councils held at Niagara, Presqu'isle (Erie),
      and Detroit. Pontiac had fled to the Maumee country to the west of Lake
      Erie, whence he still hurled his ineffectual threats at the "dogs in red."
      His power, however, was broken. The most he could do was to gather four
      hundred warriors on the Maumee and Illinois and present himself at Fort
      Chartres with a demand for weapons and ammunition with which to keep up
      the war. The French 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_018" id="Page_018">18</a></span>
			commander, who was now daily awaiting orders to turn the fortress over to 
			the English, refused; and a deputation dispatched to New Orleans in quest 
			of the desired equipment received no reply save that New Orleans itself, 
			with all the country west of the river, had been ceded to Spain. The 
			futility of further resistance on the part of Pontiac was apparent. In 
			1765 the disappointed chieftain gave pledges of friendship; and in the 
			following year he and other leaders made a formal submission to Sir
			William Johnson at Oswego, and Pontiac renounced forever the bold design 
			to make himself at a stroke lord of the West and deliverer of his country 
			from English domination.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three years the movements of this disappointed Indian leader are
      uncertain. Most of the time, apparently, he dwelt in the Maumee country,
      leading the existence of an ordinary warrior. Then, in the spring of 1769,
      he appeared at the settlements on the middle Mississippi. At the newly
      founded French town of St. Louis, on the Spanish side of the river, he
      visited an old friend, the commandant Saint Ange de Bellerive. Thence he
      crossed to Cahokia, where Indian and creole alike welcomed him and made
      him the central figure in a series of boisterous festivities.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_019" id="Page_019">19</a></span>
      An English trader in the village, observing jealously the honors that were
      paid the visitor, resolved that an old score should forthwith be evened
      up. A Kaskaskian redskin was bribed, with a barrel of liquor and with
      promises of further reward, to put the fallen leader out of the way; and
      the bargain was hardly sealed before the deed was done. Stealing upon his
      victim as he walked in the neighboring forest, the assassin buried a
      tomahawk in his brain, and "thus basely," in the words of Parkman,
      "perished the champion of a ruined race." Claimed by Saint-Ange, the body
      was borne across the river and buried with military honors near the new
      Fort St. Louis. The site of Pontiac's grave was soon forgotten, and today
      the people of a great city trample over and about it without heed.

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">Benjamin Franklin</span>, who was in London in 1760 
			as agent of the Pennsylvania Assembly, gave the British ministers some 
			wholesome advice on the terms of the peace that should be made with 
			France. The St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes regions, he said, must be 
			retained by England at all costs. Moreover, the Mississippi Valley must 
			be taken, in order to provide for the growing populations of the seaboard 
			colonies suitable lands in the interior, and so keep them engaged in 
			agriculture. Otherwise these populations would turn to manufacturing, 
			and the industries of the mother country would suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The treaty of peace, three years later, brought the settlement which
      Franklin suggested. The vast American back country, with its inviting
      rivers and lakes, its shaded hills, and its sunny prairies, became English
      territory. The English people had, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_021" id="Page_021">21</a></span>
			however, only the vaguest notion of the extent, appearance, and resources 
			of their new possession. Even the officials who drew the treaty were as 
			ignorant of the country as of middle Africa. Prior to the outbreak of the 
			war no widely known English writer had tried to describe it; and the 
			absorbing French books of Lahontan, Hennepin, and Charlevoix had reached 
			but a small circle. The prolonged conflict in America naturally stimulated 
			interest in the new country. The place-names of the upper Ohio became 
			household words, and enterprising publishers put out not only translations 
			of the French writers but compilations by Englishmen designed, in true 
			journalistic fashion, to meet the demands of the hour for information.
    </p>
    <p>
      These publications displayed amazing misconceptions of the lands
      described. They neither estimated aright the number and strength of the
      French settlements nor dispelled the idea that the western country was of
      little value. Even the most brilliant Englishman of the day, Dr. Samuel
      Johnson, an ardent defender of the treaty of 1763, wrote that the large
      tracts of America added by the war to the British dominions were "only the
      barren parts of the continent, the refuse of the earlier adventurers,
      which the French, who came last, had 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_022" id="Page_022">22</a></span>
			taken only as better than nothing." As late indeed as 1789, William Knox, 
			long Under-Secretary for the Colonies, declared that Americans could not 
			settle the western territory "for ages," and that the region must be given 
			up to barbarism like the plains of Asia, with a population as unstable as 
			the Scythians and Tartars. But the shortsightedness of these distant 
			critics can be forgiven when one recalls that Franklin himself, while 
			conjuring up a splendid vision of the western valleys teeming with a 
			thriving population, supposed that the dream would not be realized for 
			"some centuries." None of these observers dreamt that the territories 
			transferred in 1763 would have within seventy-five years a population 
			almost equal to that of Great Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ink with which the Treaty of Paris was signed was hardly dry before
      the King and his ministers were confronted with the task of providing
      government for the new possessions and of solving problems of land tenure
      and trade. Still more imperative were measures to conciliate the Indians;
      for already Pontiac's rebellion had been in progress four months, and the
      entire back country was aflame. It must be confessed that a continental
      wilderness swarming with murderous savages was 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_023" id="Page_023">23</a></span>
			an inheritance whose aspect was by no means altogether pleasing to the 
			English mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The easiest solution of the difficulty was to let things take their
      course. Let seaboard populations spread at will over the new lands; let
      them carry on trade in their own way, and make whatever arrangements with
      the native tribes they desire. Colonies such as Virginia and New York,
      which had extensive western claims, would have been glad to see this plan
      adopted. Strong objections, however, were raised. Colonies which had no
      western claims feared the effects of the advantages which their more
      fortunate neighbors would enjoy. Men who had invested heavily in lands
      lying west of the mountains felt that their returns would be diminished
      and delayed if the back country were thrown open to settlers. Some people
      thought that the Indians had a moral right to protection against wholesale
      white invasion of their hunting-grounds, and many considered it expedient,
      at all events, to offer such protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, however, it was the King and his ministers who had it in their
      power to settle the question; and from their point of view it was
      desirable to keep the western territories as much as possible apart from
      the older colonies, and to regulate, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_024" id="Page_024">24</a></span>
			with farsighted policy, their settlement and trade. Eventually, it was 
			believed, the territories would be cut into new colonies; and experience 
			with the seaboard dependencies was already such as to suggest the 
			desirability of having the future settlements more completely under 
			government control from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      After due consideration, King George and his ministers made known their
      policy on October 7, 1763, in a comprehensive proclamation. The first
      subject dealt with was government. Four new provinces&mdash;"Quebec, East
      Florida, West Florida, and Grenada" &sup1;&mdash;were set up in the ceded
      territories, and their populations were guaranteed all the rights and
      privileges enjoyed by the inhabitants of the older colonies. The
      Mississippi Valley, however, was included in no one of these provinces;
      and, curiously, there was no provision whatever for the government of the
      French settlements lying 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_025" id="Page_025">25</a></span>
			within it. The number and size of these settlements were underestimated, 
			and apparently it was supposed that all the <i>habitants</i> and soldiers 
			would avail themselves of their privilege of withdrawing from the ceded 
			territories.
    </p>
<div class="footer">
		<p>
        <a id="footer_2-1" name="footer_2-1"></a>				
&sup1; The Proclamation of 1763 drew the boundaries of "four distinct
and separate governments." Grenada was to include the island of that
name, together with the Grenadines, Dominico, St. Vincent, and Tobago.
The Floridas lay south of the bounds of Georgia and east of the
Mississippi River. The Apalachicola River was to be the dividing line
between East and West Florida. Quebec included the modern province of
that name and that part of Ontario lying north of a line drawn from Lake
Nipissing to the point where the forty-fifth parallel intersects the St.
Lawrence River.
</p>
</div>
    <p>
      The disposition made of the great rectangular area bounded by the
      Alleghanies, the Mississippi, the Lakes, and the Gulf, was fairly
      startling. With fine disregard of the chartered claims of the seaboard
      colonies and of the rights of pioneers already settled on frontier farms,
      the whole was erected into an Indian reserve. No "loving subject" might
      purchase land or settle in the territory without special license; present
      residents should "forthwith remove themselves"; trade should be carried on
      only by permit and under close surveillance; officers were to be stationed
      among the tribes to preserve friendly relations and to apprehend fugitives
      from colonial justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objects of this drastic scheme were never clearly stated. Franklin
      believed that the main purpose was to conciliate the Indians. Washington
      agreed with him. Later historians have generally thought that what the
      English Government had chiefly in mind was to limit the bounds of the
      seaboard colonies, with a view to preserving imperial 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_026" id="Page_026">26</a></span>
			control over colonial affairs. Very likely both of these motives weighed 
			heavily in the decision. At all events, Lord Hillsborough, who presided 
			over the meetings of the Lords of Trade when the proclamation was 
			discussed, subsequently wrote that the "capital object" of the 
			Government's policy was to confine the colonies so that they should be 
			kept in easy reach of British trade and of the authority necessary to 
			keep them in due subordination to the mother country, and he added that 
			the extension of the fur trade depended "entirely upon the Indians being 
			undisturbed in the possession of their hunting-grounds." &sup1;
    </p>
<div class="footer">
		<p>
        <a id="footer_2-2" name="footer_2-2"></a>
&sup1; But as Lord Hillsborough had just taken office and adopted
bodily a policy formulated by his predecessor, he is none too good an
authority. See Alvord's <i>Mississippi Valley in British Politics</i>, 
vol. I, pp. 203-4.
</p>
</div>
    <p>
      It does not follow that the King and his advisers intended that the
      territory should be kept forever intact as a forest preserve. They seem to
      have contemplated that, from time to time, cessions would be secured from
      the Indians and tracts would be opened for settlement. But every move was
      to be made in accordance with plans formulated or authorized in England.
      The restrictive policy won by no means universal assent in the mother
      country. The Whigs generally opposed it, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_027" id="Page_027">27</a></span>
			and Burke thundered against it as "an attempt to keep as a lair of wild 
			beasts that earth which God, by an express charter, has given to the 
			children of men."
    </p>
    <p>
      In America there was a disposition to take the proclamation lightly as
      being a mere sop to the Indians. But wherever it was regarded seriously,
      it was hotly resented. After passing through an arduous war, the colonists
      were ready to enter upon a new expansive era. The western territories were
      theirs by charter, by settlement, and by conquest. The Indian population,
      they believed, belonged to the unprogressive and unproductive peoples of
      the earth. Every acre of fertile soil in America called to the thrifty
      agriculturist; every westward flowing river invited to trade and
      settlement&mdash;as well, therefore, seek to keep back the ocean with a 
			broom as to stop by mere decree the tide of homeseekers. Some of the 
			colonies made honest attempts to compel the removal of settlers from the 
			reserved lands beyond their borders, and Pennsylvania went so far as to 
			decree the death penalty for all who should refuse to remove. But the law 
			was never enforced.
    </p>
		<hr class="break" />
    <p>
      The news of the cession of the eastern bank of the Mississippi to the
      English brought consternation to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_028" id="Page_028">28</a></span>
			the two or three thousand French people living in the settlements of the 
			Kaskaskia, Illinois, and Wabash regions. The transfer of the western bank 
			to Spain did not become known promptly, and for months the 
			<i>habitants</i> supposed that by taking up their abode on the opposite 
			side of the stream they would continue under their own flag. Many of them 
			crossed the Mississippi to find new abodes even after it was announced 
			that the land had passed to Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      From first to last these settlements on the Mississippi, the Wabash, and
      the Illinois had remained, in French hands, mere sprawling villages. The
      largest of them, Kaskaskia, may have contained in its most flourishing
      days two thousand people, many of them <i>voyageurs, coureurs-de-bois,</i>
      converted Indians, and transients of one sort or another. In 1765 there
      were not above seventy permanent families. Few of the towns, indeed,
      attained a population of more than two or three hundred. All French
      colonial enterprise had been based on the assumption that settlers would
      be few. The trader preferred it so, because settlements meant restrictions
      upon his traffic. The Jesuit was of the same mind, because such
      settlements broke up his mission field. The Government 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_029" id="Page_029">29</a></span>
			at Paris forbade the emigration of the one class of people that cared to 
			emigrate, the Huguenots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though some of the settlements had picturesque sites and others drew
      distinction from their fortifications, in general they presented a drab
      appearance. There were usually two or three long, narrow streets, with no
      paving, and often knee-deep with mud. The houses were built on either
      side, at intervals sufficient to give space for yards and garden plots,
      each homestead being enclosed with a crude picket fence. Wood and thatch
      were the commonest building materials, although stone was sometimes used;
      and the houses were regularly one story high, with large vine-covered
      verandas. Land was abundant and cheap. Every enterprising settler had a
      plot for himself, and as a rule one large field, or more, was held for use
      in common. In these, the operations of ploughing, sowing, and reaping were
      carefully regulated by public ordinance. Occasionally a village drew some
      distinction from the proximity of a large, well-managed estate, such as
      that of the opulent M. Beauvais of Kaskaskia, in whose mill and brewery
      more than eighty slaves were employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agriculture was carried on somewhat extensively, and it is recorded that,
      in the year 1746 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_030" id="Page_030">30</a></span>
			alone, when there was a shortage of foodstuffs at New Orleans, the 
			Illinois settlers were able to send thither "upward of eight hundred 
			thousand weight of flour." Hunting and trading, however, continued to be 
			the principal occupations; and the sugar, indigo, cotton, and other
      luxuries which the people were able to import directly from Europe were
      paid for mainly with consignments of furs, hides, tallow, and beeswax.
      Money was practically unknown in the settlements, so that domestic trade
      likewise took the form of simple barter. Periods of industry and
      prosperity alternated with periods of depression, and the easy-going
      <i>habitants</i>&mdash;"farmers, hunters, traders by turn, with a strong
      admixture of unprogressive Indian blood"&mdash;tended always to relapse
      into utter indolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these French towns, however, were seats of culture; and none was
      wholly barren of diversions. Kaskaskia had a Jesuit college and likewise a
      monastery. Cahokia had a school for Indian youth. Fort Chartres, we are
      gravely told, was "the center of life and fashion in the West." If
      everyday existence was humdrum, the villagers had always the opportunity
      for voluble conversation "each from his own balcony"; and there were
      scores of Church festivals, not to mention birthdays, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_031" id="Page_031">31</a></span>
			visits of travelers or neighbors, and homecomings of hunters and traders, 
			which invited to festivity. Balls and dances and other merrymakings at 
			which the whole village assembled supplied the wants of a people 
			proverbially fond of amusement. Indeed, French civilization in the 
			Mississippi and Illinois country was by no means without charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kaskaskia, in the wonderfully fertile "American Bottom," maintained its
      existence, in spite of the cession to the English, as did also Vincennes
      farther east on the Wabash. Fort Chartres, a stout fortification whose
      walls were more than two feet thick, remained the seat of the principal
      garrison, and some traces of French occupancy survived on the Illinois.
      Cahokia was deserted, save for the splendid mission-farm of St. Sulpice,
      with its thirty slaves, its herd of cattle, and its mill, which the
      fathers before returning to France sold to a thrifty Frenchman not averse
      to becoming an English subject. A few posts were abandoned altogether.
      Some of the departing inhabitants went back to France; some followed the
      French commandant, Neyon de Villiers, down the river to New Orleans; many
      gathered up their possessions, even to the frames and clapboards of their
      houses, and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_032" id="Page_032">32</a></span>
			took refuge in the new towns which sprang up on the western bank. One of 
			these new settlements was Ste. Genevi&egrave;ve, strategically located 
			near the lead mines from which the entire region had long drawn its 
			supplies of shot. Another, which was destined to greater importance,
      was St. Louis, established as a trading post on the richly wooded bluffs
      opposite Cahokia by Pierre Lacl&egrave;de in 1764.
    </p>
    <p>
      Associated with Lacl&egrave;de in his fur-trading operations at the new 
			post was a lithe young man named Pierre Chouteau. In 1846&mdash;eighty-two 
			years afterwards&mdash;Francis Parkman sat on the spacious veranda of 
			Pierre Chouteau's country house near the city of St. Louis and heard from 
			the lips of the venerable merchant stories of Pontiac, Saint-Ange, 
			Croghan, and all the western worthies, red and white, of two full 
			generations. "Not all the magic of a dream," the historian remarks, "nor 
			the enchantments of an Arabian tale, could outmatch the waking realities 
			which were to rise upon the vision of Pierre Chouteau. Where, in his 
			youth, he had climbed the woody bluff, and looked abroad on prairies 
			dotted with bison, he saw, with the dim eye of his old age, the land 
			darkened for many a furlong with the clustered roofs of the western 
			metropolis. For the silence of the wilderness, he 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_033" id="Page_033">33</a></span>
			heard the clang and turmoil of human labor, the din of congregated 
			thousands; and where the great river rolls down through the forest, in 
			lonely grandeur, he saw the waters lashed into foam beneath the prows of 
			panting steamboats, flocking to the broad levee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pontiac's war long kept the English from taking actual possession of the
      western country. Meanwhile Saint-Ange, commanding the remnant of the
      French garrison at Fort Chartres, resisted as best he could the demands of
      the redskins for assistance against their common enemy and hoped daily for
      the appearance of an English force to relieve him of his difficult 
			position. In the spring of 1764 an English officer, Major Loftus, with a 
			body of troops lately employed in planting English authority in "East 
			Florida" and "West Florida," set out from New Orleans to take possession 
			of the up-river settlements. A few miles above the mouth of the Red, 
			however, the boats were fired on, without warning, from both banks of the 
			stream, and many of the men were killed or wounded. The expedition 
			retreated down the river with all possible speed. This display of 
			faintheartedness won the keen ridicule of the French, and the Governor, 
			D'Abadie, with mock
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_034" id="Page_034">34</a></span>
      magnanimity, offered an escort of French soldiery to protect the party on
      its way back to Pensacola! Within a few months a second attempt was
      projected, but news of the bad temper of the Indians caused the leader,
      Captain Pittman, to turn back after reaching New Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baffled in this direction, the new commander-in-chief, General Gage,
      resolved to accomplish the desired end by an expedition from Fort Pitt.
      Pontiac, however, was known to be still plotting vengeance at that time,
      and it seemed advisable to break the way for the proposed expedition by a
      special mission to placate the Indians. For this delicate task Sir William
      Johnson selected a trader of long experience and of good standing among
      the western tribes, George Croghan. Notwithstanding many mishaps, the plan
      was carried out. With two boats and a considerable party of soldiers and
      friendly Delawares, Croghan left Fort Pitt in May, 1765. As he descended
      the Ohio he carefully plotted the river's windings and wrote out an
      interesting description of the fauna and flora observed. All went well
      until he reached the mouth of the Wabash. There the party was set upon by
      a band of Kickapoos, who killed half a dozen of his men. Fluent apologies
      were at once offered. They had 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_035" id="Page_035">35</a></span>
			made the attack, they explained, only because the French had reported that 
			the Indians with Croghan's band were Cherokees, the Kickapoos' most deadly 
			enemies. Now that their mistake was apparent, the artful emissaries 
			declared, their regret was indeed deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this was sheer pretense, and Croghan and his surviving followers
      were kept under close guard and were carried along with the Kickapoo band
      up the Wabash to Vincennes, where the trader encountered old Indian
      friends who soundly rebuked the captors for their inhospitality. Croghan
      knew the Indian nature too well to attempt to thwart the plans of his
      "hosts." Accordingly he went on with the band to the upper Wabash post
      Ouiatanon, where he received deputation after deputation from the
      neighboring tribes, smoked pipes of peace, made speeches, and shook hands
      with greasy warriors by the score. Here came a messenger from Saint-Ange
      asking him to proceed to Fort Chartres. Here, also, Pontiac met him, and,
      after being assured that the English had no intention of enslaving the
      natives, declared that he would no longer stand in the conquerors' path.
      Though in unexpected manner, Croghan's mission was accomplished, and, with
      many evidences of favor from 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_036" id="Page_036">36</a></span>
			the natives, he went on to Detroit and thence to Niagara, where he 
			reported to Johnson that the situation in the West was ripe for the 
			establishment of English sovereignty.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reason for further delay, and Captain Thomas Sterling was
      dispatched with a hundred Highland veterans to take over the settlements.
      Descending the Ohio from Fort Pitt, the expedition reached Fort Chartres
      just as the frosty air began to presage the coming of winter. On October
      10, 1765,&mdash;more than two and a half years after the signing of the
      Treaty of Paris,&mdash;Saint-Ange made the long-desired transfer of
      authority. General Gage's high-sounding proclamation was read, the British
      flag was run up, and Sterling's red-coated soldiery established itself in
      the citadel. In due time small detachments were sent to Vincennes and
      other posts; and the triumph of the British power over Frenchman and
      Indian was complete. Saint-Ange retired with his little garrison to St.
      Louis, where, until the arrival of a Spanish lieutenant-governor in 1770,
      he acted by common consent as chief magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creoles who passed under the English flag suffered little from the
      change. Their property and trading interests were not molested, and the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_037" id="Page_037">37</a></span>
      English commandants made no effort to displace the old laws and usages.
      Documents were written and records were kept in French as well as English.
      The village priest and the notary retained their accustomed places of
      paternal authority. The old idyllic life went on. Population increased but
      little; barter, hunting, and trapping still furnished the means of a
      simple subsistence; and with music, dancing, and holiday festivities the
      light-hearted populace managed to crowd more pleasure into a year than the
      average English frontiersman got in a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a year or two after the European pacification of 1763 Indian
      disturbances held back the flood of settlers preparing to enter, through
      the Alleghany passes, the upper valleys of the westward flowing rivers.
      Neither Indian depredations nor proclamations of kings, however, could
      long interpose an effectual restraint. The supreme object of the settlers
      was to obtain land. Formerly there was land enough for all along the
      coasts or in the nearer uplands. But population, as Franklin computed, was
      doubling in twenty-five years; vacant areas had already been occupied; and
      desirable lands had been gathered into great speculative holdings.
      Newcomers were consequently forced to cross the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_038" id="Page_038">38</a></span>
			mountains&mdash;and not only newcomers, but all residents who were still 
			land-hungry and ambitious to better their condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      To such the appeal of the great West was irresistible. The English
      Government might indeed regard the region as a "barren waste" or a
      "profitless wilderness," but not so the Scotch-Irish, Huguenot, and
      Palatine homeseekers who poured by the thousands through the Chesapeake
      and Delaware ports. Pushing past the settled seaboard country, these
      rugged men of adventure plunged joyously into the forest depths and became
      no less the founders of the coming nation than were the Pilgrims and the
      Cavaliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ahead of the home-builder, however, went the speculator. It has been
      remarked that "from the time when Joliet and La Salle first found their
      way into the heart of the great West up to the present day when far-off
      Alaska is in the throes of development, 'big business' has been engaged in
      western speculation." &sup1; In pre-revolutionary days this speculation 
			took the form of procuring, by grant or purchase, large tracts of western 
			land which were to be sold and colonized at a profit. Franklin was 
			interested in a number of such projects. Washington, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_039" id="Page_039">39</a></span>
			the Lees, and a number of other prominent Virginians were connected with 
			an enterprise which absorbed the old Ohio Company; and in 1770 Washington, 
			piloted by Croghan, visited the Ohio country with a view to the discovery 
			of desirable areas. Eventually he acquired western holdings amounting to 
			thirty-three thousand acres, with a water-front of sixteen miles on the 
			Ohio and of forty miles on the Great Kanawha.

    <p>
      In 1773 a company promoted by Samuel Wharton, Benjamin Franklin, William
      Johnson, and a London banker, Thomas Walpole, secured the grant of two and
      a half million acres between the Alleghanies and the Ohio, which was to be
      the seat of a colony called Vandalia. This departure from the policy laid
      down in the Proclamation of 1763 was made reluctantly, but with a view to
      giving a definite western limit to the seaboard provinces. The
      Government's purpose was fully understood in America, and the project was
      warmly opposed, especially by Virginia, the chartered claimant of the
      territory. The early outbreak of the Revolutionary War wrecked the
      project, and nothing ever came of it&mdash;or indeed of any colonization
      proposal contemporary with it. By and large, the building of the West was
      to be the work, not of colonizing 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_040" id="Page_040">40</a></span>
			companies or other corporate interests, but of individual homeseekers, 
			moving into the new country on their own responsibility and settling 
			where and when their own interests and inclinations led.

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">One</span> of the grievances given prominence 
			in the Declaration of Independence was that the English Crown had 
			"abolished the free system of English laws in a neighbouring province, 
			establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its 
			boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument 
			for introducing the same arbitrary rule into these colonies."
      The measure which was in the minds of the signers was the Quebec Act of
      1774; and the feature to which they especially objected was the extension
      of this peculiarly governed Canadian province to include the whole of the
      territory north of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Quebec Act was passed primarily to remedy a curious mistake made by
      King George's ministers eleven years earlier. The Proclamation of 1763 had
      been intended to apply to the new French-speaking 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_042" id="Page_042">42</a></span>
			possessions in only a general way, leaving matters of government and law 
			to be regulated at a later date. But through oversight it ordained the 
			establishment of English law, and even of a representative assembly, 
			precisely as in the other new provinces. The English governors were thus 
			put in an awkward position. They were required to introduce English 
			political forms and legal practices. Yet the inexperience and suspicion 
			of the people made it unwise, if not impossible, to do so. When, for 
			example, jury trial was broached, the peasants professed to be quite 
			unable to understand why the English should prefer to have matters of law 
			decided by tailors and shoemakers rather than by a judge; and as for a 
			legislature, they frankly confessed that assemblies "had drawn upon other 
			colonies so much distress, and had occasioned so much riot and bloodshed, 
			that they had hoped never to have one."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Act of 1774 relieved the situation by restoring French law in civil
      affairs, abolishing jury trial except in criminal cases, rescinding the
      grant of representative government, and confirming the Catholic clergy in
      the rights and privileges which they had enjoyed under the old 
			r&eacute;gime. This would have aroused no great amount of feeling 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_043" id="Page_043">43</a></span>
			among New Englanders and Virginians if the new arrangements had been 
			confined to the bounds of the original province. But they were not so 
			restricted. On the contrary, the new province was made to include the 
			great region between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi, southward to 
			the Ohio; and it was freely charged that a principal object of the 
			English Government was to sever the West from the shore colonies and 
			permanently link it with the St. Lawrence Valley rather than with the 
			Atlantic slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, the Quebec Act marked the beginning of civil government in
      the great Northwest. On November 9, 1775, Henry Hamilton appeared as
      Lieutenant-Governor at the new capital, Detroit. Already the "shot that 
			was heard around the world" had been fired on Lexington Green; and 
			Hamilton had been obliged to thread his way through General Montgomery's 
			lines about Montreal in the guise of a Canadian. Arrived at his new seat 
			of authority, he found a pleasant, freshly fortified town whose white
      population had grown to fifteen hundred, including a considerable number
      of English-speaking settlers. The country round was overrun with traders,
      who cheated and cajoled the Indians without conscience; the natives, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044">44</a></span>
			in turn, were a nondescript lot, showing in pitiful manner the bad effects 
			of their contact with the whites.
    </p>
    <p>
      As related by a contemporary chronicler&mdash;a Pennsylvanian who lived
      for years among the western tribes&mdash;an Indian hunting party on
      arriving at Detroit would trade perhaps a third of the peltries which they
      brought in for fine clothes, ammunition, paint, tobacco, and like
      articles. Then a keg of brandy would be purchased, and a council would be
      held to decide who was to get drunk and who to keep sober. All arms and
      clubs were taken away and hidden, and the orgy would begin. It was the
      task of those who kept sober to prevent the drunken ones from killing one
      another, a task always hazardous and frequently unsuccessful, sometimes as
      many as five being killed in a night. When the keg was empty, brandy was
      brought by the kettleful and ladled out with large wooden spoons; and this
      was kept up until the last skin had been disposed of. Then, dejected,
      wounded, lamed, with their fine new shirts torn, their blankets burned,
      and with nothing but their ammunition and tobacco saved, they would start
      off down the river to hunt in the Ohio country and begin again the same
      round of alternating toil 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_045" id="Page_045">45</a></span>
			and debauchery. In the history of the country there is hardly a more 
			depressing chapter than that which records the easy descent of the red 
			man, once his taste for "fire water" was developed, to bestiality and 
			impotence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coming on of the Revolution produced no immediate effects in the West.
      The meaning of the occurrences round Boston was but slowly grasped by the
      frontier folk. There was little indeed that the Westerners could do to
      help the cause of the eastern patriots, and most of them, if left alone,
      would have been only distant spectators of the conflict. But orders given
      to the British agents and commanders called for the ravaging of the
      trans-Alleghany country; and as a consequence the West became an important
      theater of hostilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British agents had no troops with which to undertake military
      operations on a considerable scale, but they had one great 
			resource&mdash;the Indians&mdash;and this they used with a reckless 
			disregard of all considerations of humanity. In the summer of 1776 the 
			Cherokees were furnished with fifty horse-loads of ammunition and were 
			turned loose upon the back country of Georgia and the Carolinas. Other 
			tribes were prompted to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_046" id="Page_046">46</a></span>
			depredations farther north. White, half-breed, and Indian agents went
      through the forests inciting the natives to deeds of horror; prices were
      fixed on scalps&mdash;and it is significant of the temper of these agents
      that a woman's scalp was paid for as readily as a man's.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every corner of the wilderness the bloody scenes of Pontiac's war were
      now re&euml;nacted. Bands of savages lurked about the settlements, ready to
      attack at any unguarded moment; and wherever the thin blue smoke of a
      settler's cabin rose, prowlers lay in wait. A woman might not safely go a
      hundred yards to milk a cow, or a man lead a horse to water. The farmer
      carried a gun strapped to his side as he ploughed, and he scarcely dared
      venture into the woods for the winter's supply of fuel and game. Hardly a
      day passed on which a riderless horse did not come galloping into some
      lonely clearing, telling of a fresh tragedy on the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rousing of the Indians against the frontiersmen was an odious act. The
      people of the back country were in not the slightest degree responsible
      for the revolt against British authority in the East. They were
      non-combatants, and no amount of success in sweeping them from their homes
      could 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_047" id="Page_047">47</a></span>
			affect the larger outcome. The crowning villainy of this shameful
      policy was the turning of the redskins loose to prey upon helpless women
      and children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The responsibility for this inhumanity must be borne in some degree by the
      government of George III. "God and nature," wrote the Earl of Suffolk
      piously, "hath put into our hands the scalping-knife and tomahawk, to
      torture them into unconditional submission." But the fault lay chiefly
      with the British officers at the western posts&mdash;most of all, with
      Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton at Detroit. Probably no British
      representative in America was on better terms with the natives. He drank
      with them, sang war-songs with them, and received them with open arms when
      they came in from the forests with the scalps of white men dangling at
      their belts. A great council on the banks of the Detroit in June, 1778,
      was duly opened with prayer, after which Hamilton harangued the assembled
      Chippewas, Hurons, Mohawks, and Potawatomi on their "duties" in the war
      and congratulated them on the increasing numbers of their prisoners and
      scalps, and then urged them to redoubled activity by holding out the
      prospect of the complete expulsion of white men from the great interior
      hunting-grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_048" id="Page_048">48</a></span>
      Scarcely were the deputations attending this council well on their way
      homewards when a courier arrived from the Illinois country bringing
      startling news. The story was that a band of three hundred rebels led by
      one George Rogers Clark had fallen upon the Kaskaskia settlements, had
      thrown the commandant into irons, and had exacted from the populace an
      oath of allegiance to the Continental Congress. It was reported, too, that
      Cahokia had been taken, and that, even as the messenger was leaving
      Kaskaskia, "Gibault, a French priest, had his horse ready saddled to go to
      Vincennes to receive the submission of the inhabitants in the name of the
      rebels."
    </p>
    <p>
      George Rogers Clark was a Virginian, born in the foothills of Albemarle
      County three years before Braddock's defeat. His family was not of the
      landed gentry, but he received some education, and then, like Washington
      and many other adventuresome young men of the day, became a surveyor. At
      the age of twenty-two he was a member of Governor Dunmore's staff. During
      a surveying expedition he visited Kentucky, which so pleased him that in
      1774 he decided to make that part of the back country his home. He was
      even then a man of powerful frame, with broad 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_049" id="Page_049">49</a></span>
			brow, keen blue eyes, and a dash of red in his hair from a Scottish 
			ancestress&mdash;a man, too, of ardent patriotism, strong common sense, 
			and exceptional powers of initiative and leadership. Small wonder that in 
			the rapidly developing commonwealth beyond the mountains he quickly 
			became a dominating spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a view to organizing a civil government and impressing upon the
      Virginia authorities the need of defending the western settlements, the
      men of Kentucky held a convention at Harrodsburg in the spring of 1775 and
      elected two delegates to present their petition to the Virginia Assembly.
      Clark was one of them. The journey to Williamsburg was long and arduous,
      and the delegates arrived only to find that the Legislature had adjourned.
      The visit, none the less, gave Clark an opportunity to explain to the new
      Governor&mdash;"a certain Patrick Henry, of Hanover County," as the
      royalist Dunmore contemptuously styled his successor&mdash;the situation
      in the back country and to obtain five hundred pounds of powder. He also
      induced the authorities to take steps which led to the definite
      organization of Kentucky as a county of Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bloody days that followed, most of the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_050" id="Page_050">50</a></span>
			pioneers saw nothing to be done except to keep close guard and beat off 
			the Indians when they came. A year or two of that sort of desperate 
			uncertainty gave Clark an idea. Why not meet the trouble at its source by 
			capturing the British posts and suppressing the commandants whose orders 
			were mainly responsible for the atrocities? There was just one obstacle: 
			Kentucky could spare neither men nor money for the undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring of 1777 two young hunters, disguised as traders, were
      dispatched to the Illinois country and to the neighborhood of Vincennes,
      to spy out the land. They brought back word that the posts were not
      heavily manned, and that the French-speaking population took little
      interest in the war and was far from reconciled to British rule. The
      prospect seemed favorable. Without making his purpose known to anyone,
      Clark forthwith joined a band of disheartened settlers and made his way
      with them over the Wilderness Trail to Virginia. By this time a plan on
      the part of the rebels for the defense of the Kentucky settlements had
      grown into a scheme for the conquest of the whole Northwest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clark's proposal came opportunely. Burgoyne's surrender had given the
      colonial cause a rosy hue, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_051" id="Page_051">51</a></span>
			and already the question of the occupation of the Northwest had come up 
			for discussion in Congress. Governor Henry thought well of the plan. He 
			called Thomas Jefferson, George Mason, and George Wythe into conference, 
			and on January 2, 1778, Clark was given two sets of orders&mdash;one, for 
			publication, commissioning him to raise seven companies of fifty men each 
			"in any county of the Commonwealth" for militia duty in Kentucky, the 
			other, secret, authorizing him to use this force in an expedition for the 
			capture of the "British post at Kaskasky." To meet the costs, only twelve 
			hundred pounds in depreciated continental currency could be raised. But 
			the Governor and his friends promised to try to secure three hundred acres 
			of land for each soldier, in case the project should succeed. The 
			strictest secrecy was preserved, and, even if the Legislature had been in 
			session, the project would probably not have been divulged to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men and supplies were gathered at Fort Pitt and Wheeling and were carried
      down the Ohio to "the Falls," opposite the site of Louisville. The real
      object of the expedition was concealed until this point was reached. On
      learning of the project, the men were surprised, and some refused to go
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_052" id="Page_052">52</a></span>
      farther. But in a few weeks one hundred and seventy-five men, organized in
      four companies, were in readiness. The start was made on the 24th of June.
      Just as the little flotilla of clumsy flatboats was caught by the rapid
      current, the landscape was darkened by an eclipse of the sun. The
      superstitious said that this was surely an evil omen. But Clark was no
      believer in omens, and he ordered the <i>bateaux</i> to proceed. He had 
			lately received news of the French alliance, and was surer than ever that 
			the <i>habitants</i> would make common cause with his forces and give him 
			complete success.
    </p>
    <p>
      To appear on the Mississippi was to run the risk of betraying the object
      of the expedition to the defenders of the posts. Hence the wily commander
      decided to make the last stages of his advance by an overland route. At
      the deserted site of Fort Massac, nine miles below the mouth of the
      Tennessee, the little army left the Ohio and struck off northwest on a
      march of one hundred and twenty miles, as the crow flies, across the
      tangled forests and rich prairies of southern Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six days brought the invaders to the Kaskaskia River, three miles above
      the principal settlement. Stealing silently along the bank of the stream
      on 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_053" id="Page_053">53</a></span>
			the night of the 4th of July, they crossed in boats which they seized
      at a farmhouse and arrived at the palisades wholly unobserved. Half of the
      force was stationed in the form of a cordon, so that no one might escape.
      The remainder followed Clark through an unguarded gateway into the
      village.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to a story long current, the officials of the post were that
      night giving a ball, and all of the &eacute;lite, not of Kaskaskia alone 
			but of the neighboring settlements as well, were joyously dancing in one 
			of the larger rooms of the fort. Leaving his men some paces distant, Clark
      stepped to the entrance of the hall, and for some time leaned unobserved
      against the door-post, grimly watching the gayety. Suddenly the air was
      rent by a war-whoop which brought the dancers to a stop. An Indian brave,
      lounging in the firelight, had caught a glimpse of the tall, gaunt, buff
      and blue figure in the doorway and had recognized it. Women shrieked; men
      cursed; the musicians left their posts; all was disorder. Advancing, Clark
      struck a theatrical pose and in a voice of command told the merrymakers to
      go on with their dancing, but to take note that they now danced, not as
      subjects of King George but as Virginians. Finding that they were in no
      mood for further diversion, he 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_054" id="Page_054">54</a></span>
			sent them to their homes; and all night they shivered with fear, daring 
			not so much as to light a candle lest they should be set upon and murdered 
			in their beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      This account is wholly unsupported by contemporary testimony, and it
      probably sprang from the imagination of some good frontier story-teller.
      It contains at least this much truth, that the settlement, after being
      thrown into panic, was quickly and easily taken. Curiously enough, the
      commandant was a Frenchman, Rocheblave, who had thriftily entered the
      British service. True to the trust reposed in him, he protested and
      threatened, but to no avail. The garrison, now much diminished, was
      helpless, and the populace&mdash;British, French, and Indian alike&mdash;was
      not disposed to court disaster by offering armed resistance. Hence, on the
      morning after the capture the oath of fidelity was administered, and the
      American flag was hoisted for the first time within view of the Father of
      Waters. After dispatching word to General Carleton that he had been
      compelled to surrender the post to "the self-styled Colonel, Mr. Clark,"
      Rocheblave was sent as a captive to Williamsburg, where he soon broke
      parole and escaped. His slaves were sold for five hundred pounds, and the
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_055" id="Page_055">55</a></span>
			money was distributed among the troops. Cahokia was occupied without
      resistance, and the French priest, Father Pierre Gibault, whose parish
      extended from Lake Superior to the Ohio, volunteered to go to Vincennes
      and win its inhabitants to the American cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Kaskaskia and Cahokia, the Wabash settlement had been put in charge
      of a commandant of French descent. The village, however, was at the moment
      without a garrison, and its chief stronghold, Fort Sackville, was
      untenanted. Gibault argued forcefully for acceptance of American
      sovereignty, and within two days the entire population filed into the
      little church and took the oath of allegiance. The astonished Indians were
      given to understand that their former "Great Father," the King of France,
      had returned to life, and that they must comply promptly with his wishes
      or incur his everlasting wrath for having given aid to the despised
      British.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus without the firing of a shot or the shedding of a drop of blood, the
      vast Illinois and Wabash country was won for the future United States.
      Clark's plan was such that its success was assured by its very audacity.
      It never occurred to the British authorities that their far western forts
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_056" id="Page_056">56</a></span>
      were in danger, and they were wholly unprepared to fly to the defense of
      such distant posts. British sovereignty on the Mississippi was never
      recovered; and in the autumn of 1778 Virginia took steps to organize her
      new conquest by setting up the county of Illinois, which included all her
      territories lying "on the western side of the Ohio."

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton</span> had many faults, 
			but sloth was not one of them; and when he heard what had happened he 
			promptly decided to regain the posts and take the upstart Kentucky 
			conqueror captive. Emissaries were sent to the Wabash country to stir up 
			the Indians, and for weeks the Detroit settlement resounded with 
			preparations for the expedition. Boats were built or repaired, guns were 
			cleaned, ammunition was collected in boxes, provisions were put up in kegs 
			or bags, baubles for the Indians were made or purchased. Cattle and 
			wheels, together with a six-pounder, were sent ahead to be in readiness 
			for use at various stages of the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further weeks were consumed in awaiting reenforcements which never came;
      and in early October, when the wild geese were scudding southward before
      the first snow flurries of the coming 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_058" id="Page_058">58</a></span>
			winter, the commandant started for the reconquest with a motley force 
			of thirty-six British regulars, forty-five local volunteers, 
			seventy-nine local militia, and sixty Indians. Re&euml;nforcements were 
			gathered on the road, so that when Vincennes was reached the little army 
			numbered about five hundred. From Detroit the party dropped easily down 
			the river to Lake Erie, where it narrowly escaped destruction in a 
			blinding snowstorm. By good management, however, it was brought safely 
			to the Maumee, up whose sluggish waters the <i>bateaux</i> were 
			laboriously poled. A portage of nine miles gave access to the Wabash.
      Here the water was very shallow, and only by building occasional dikes to
      produce a current did the party find it possible to complete the journey.
      As conferences with the Indians further delayed them, it was not until a
      few days before Christmas that the invaders reached their goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The capture of Vincennes proved easy enough. The surrender, none the less,
      was made in good military style. There were two iron three-pounders in the
      wretched little fort, and one of these was loaded to the muzzle and placed
      in the open gate. As Hamilton and his men advanced, so runs a not very
      well authenticated story, Lieutenant 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_059" id="Page_059">59</a></span>
			Helm stood by the gun with a lighted taper and called sternly upon the 
			invaders to halt. The British leader demanded the surrender of the 
			garrison. Helm parleyed and asked for terms. Hamilton finally conceded 
			the honors of war, and Helm magnanimously accepted. Hamilton thereupon 
			drew up his forces in a double line, the British on one side and the 
			Indians on the other; and the garrison&mdash;one officer and one 
			soldier&mdash;solemnly marched out between them! After the
      "conquerors" had regained their equanimity, the cross of St. George was
      once more run up on the fort. A body of French militia returned to British
      allegiance with quite as much facility as it had shown in accepting
      American sovereignty under the eloquence of Father Gibault; and the French
      inhabitants, gathered again in the church, with perfectly straight faces
      acknowledged that they had "sinned against God and man" by taking sides
      with the rebels, and promised to be loyal thereafter to George III.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the British forces immediately pushed on, this same scene might have
      been repeated at Kaskaskia and Cahokia. Clark's position there was far
      from strong. Upon the expiration of their term of enlistment most of his
      men had gone back 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_060" id="Page_060">60</a></span>
			to Kentucky or Virginia, and their places had been taken mainly by 
			creoles, whose steadfastness was doubtful. Furthermore, the Indians were 
			restless, and it was only by much vigilance and bravado that they were 
			kept in a respectful mood. All this was well known to Hamilton, who now 
			proposed to follow up the recapture of the Mississippi posts by the 
			obliteration of all traces of American authority west of the Alleghanies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulties and dangers of a midwinter campaign in the flooded
      Illinois country were not to be lightly regarded, and weeks of contending
      with icy blasts and drenching rains lent a seat by an open fire unusual
      attractiveness. Hence the completion of the campaign was postponed until
      spring&mdash;a decision which proved the salvation of the American cause
      in the West. As means of subsistence were slender, most of the Detroit
      militia were sent home, and the Indians were allowed to scatter to their
      distant wigwams. The force kept at the post numbered only about eighty or
      ninety whites, with a few Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clark now had at Kaskaskia a band of slightly over a hundred men. He
      understood Hamilton's army to number five or six hundred. The outlook was
      dubious, until Fran&ccedil;ois Vigo, a friendly Spanish 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_061" id="Page_061">61</a></span>
			trader of St. Louis, escaping captivity at Vincennes, came to Kaskaskia 
			with the information that Hamilton had sent away most of his troops; and 
			this welcome news gave the doughty Kentuckian a brilliant idea. He would 
			defend his post by attacking the invaders while they were yet at 
			Vincennes, and before they were ready to resume operations. "The case is 
			desperate," he wrote to Governor Henry, "but, sir, we must either quit the 
			country or attack Mr. Hamilton." He had probably never heard of Scipio 
			Africanus but, like that indomitable Roman, he proposed to carry the war 
			straight into the enemy's country. "There were undoubtedly appalling 
			difficulties," says Mr. Roosevelt, "in the way of a midwinter march and 
			attack; and the fact that Clark attempted and performed the feat which 
			Hamilton dared not try, marks just the difference between a man of genius 
			and a good, brave, ordinary commander."
    </p>
    <p>
      Preparations were pushed with all speed. A large, flat-bottomed boat, the
      <i>Willing,</i> was fitted out with four guns and was sent down the 
			Mississippi with forty men to ascend the Ohio and the Wabash to a place of 
			rendezvous not far from the coveted post. By early February the depleted 
			companies were recruited to their full strength; and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_062" id="Page_062">62</a></span>
			after the enterprise had been solemnly blessed by Father Gibault, Clark 
			and his forces, numbering one hundred and thirty men, pushed out upon the 
			desolate, wind-swept prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance to be covered was about two hundred and thirty miles. Under
      favorable circumstances, the trip could have been made in five or six days
      and with little hardship. The rainy season, however, was now at its
      height, and the country was one vast quagmire, overrun by swollen streams
      which could be crossed only at great risk. Ten days of wearisome marching
      brought the expedition to the forks of the Little Wabash. The entire
      region between the two channels was under water, and for a little time it
      looked as if the whole enterprise would have to be given up. There were no
      boats; provisions were running low; game was scarce; and fires could not
      be built for cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Clark could not be turned back by such difficulties. He plunged ahead
      of his men, struck up songs and cheers to keep them in spirit, played the
      buffoon, went wherever danger was greatest, and by an almost unmatched
      display of bravery, tact, and firmness, won the redoubled admiration of
      his suffering followers and held them together. Murmurs arose among the
      creoles, but the Americans 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_063" id="Page_063">63</a></span>
			showed no signs of faltering. For more than a week the party floundered 
			through the freezing water, picked its way from one outcropping bit of 
			earth to another, and seldom found opportunity to eat or sleep. Rifles 
			and powder-horns had to be borne by the hour above the soldiers' heads 
			to keep them dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, on the 23d of February, a supreme effort carried the troops
      across the Horseshoe Plain, breast-deep in water, and out upon high ground
      two miles from Vincennes. By this time many of the men were so weakened
      that they could drag themselves along only with assistance. But buffalo
      meat and corn were confiscated from the canoes of some passing squaws, and
      soon the troops were refreshed and in good spirits. The battle with the
      enemy ahead seemed as nothing when compared with the struggle with the
      elements which they had successfully waged. No exploit of the kind in
      American history surpasses this, unless it be Benedict Arnold's winter
      march through the wilderness of Maine in 1775 to attack Quebec.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three creole hunters were now taken captive, and from them Clark
      learned that no one in Vincennes knew of his approach. They reported,
      however, that, although the <i>habitants</i> were tired 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_064" id="Page_064">64</a></span>
			of the "Hair-Buyer's" presence and would gladly return to American 
			allegiance, some two hundred Indians had just arrived at the fort. The 
			<i>Willing</i> had not been heard from. But an immediate attack seemed 
			the proper course; and the young colonel planned and carried it out with 
			the curious mixture of bravery and braggadocio of which he was a past 
			master.
    </p>
    <p>
      First he drew up a lordly letter, addressed to the inhabitants of the
      town, and dispatched it by one of his creole prisoners. "Gentlemen," it
      ran, "being now within two miles of your village with my army &hellip; 
			and not being willing to surprise you, I take this step to request such 
			of you as are true citizens, and willing to enjoy the liberty I bring you, 
			to remain still in your houses. And those, if any there be, that are 
			friends to the King, will instantly repair to the fort and join the 
			Hair-Buyer General and fight like men." Having thus given due warning, 
			he led his "army" forward, marching and counter-marching his meager forces 
			among the trees and hills to give an appearance of great numbers, while he 
			and his captains helped keep up the illusion by galloping wildly here and 
			there on horses they had confiscated, as if ordering a vast array. At 
			nightfall the men advanced 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_065" id="Page_065">65</a></span>
			upon the stockade and opened fire from two directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until a sergeant reeled from his chair with a bullet in his breast did
      the garrison realize that it was really under attack. The <i>habitants</i> 
			had kept their secret well. There was a beating of drums and a hurrying to
      arms, and throughout the night a hot fusillade was kept up. By firing from
      behind houses and trees, and from rifle pits that were dug before the
      attack began, the Americans virtually escaped loss; while Hamilton's
      gunners were picked off as fast as they appeared at the portholes of the
      fort. Clark's ammunition ran low, but the <i>habitants</i> furnished a 
			fresh supply and at the same time a hot breakfast for the men. In a few 
			hours the cannon were silenced, and parleys were opened. Hamilton insisted 
			that he and his garrison were "not disposed to be awed into an action 
			unworthy of British subjects," but they were plainly frightened, and Clark 
			finally sent the commandant back to the fort from a conference in the old 
			French church with the concession of one hour's time in which to decide 
			what he would do. To help him make up his mind, the American leader caused 
			half a dozen Indians who had just returned from the forests with white 
			men's scalps 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_066" id="Page_066">66</a></span>
			dangling at their belts to be tomahawked and thrown into the river
      within plain view of the garrison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surrender promptly followed. Hamilton and twenty-five of his men were sent
      off as captives to Virginia, where the commandant languished in prison
      until, in 1780, he was paroled at the suggestion of Washington. On taking
      an oath of neutrality, the remaining British sympathizers were set at
      liberty. For a second time the American flag floated over Indiana soil,
      not again to be lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after the capitulation of Hamilton, a scouting-party captured
      a relief expedition which was on its way from Detroit and placed in
      Clark's hands ten thousand pounds' worth of supplies for distribution as
      prize-money among his deserving men. The commander's cup of satisfaction
      was filled to the brim when the <i>Willing</i> appeared with a long-awaited
      messenger from Governor Henry who brought to the soldiers the thanks of
      the Legislature of Virginia for the capture of Kaskaskia and also the
      promise of more substantial reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the Illinois and Indiana country was now in American hands.
      Tenure, however, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_067" id="Page_067">67</a></span>
			was precarious so long as Detroit remained a British stronghold, and Clark 
			now broadened his plans to embrace the capture of that strategic place. 
			Leaving Vincennes in charge of a garrison of forty men, he returned to 
			Kaskaskia with the <i>Willing</i> and set about organizing a new 
			expedition. Kentucky pledged three hundred men, and Virginia promised
      to help. But when, in midsummer, the commander returned to Vincennes to
      consolidate and organize his forces, he found the numbers to be quite
      insufficient. From Kentucky there came only thirty men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disappointment followed disappointment; he was ordered to build a fort at
      the mouth of the Ohio&mdash;a project of which he had himself approved;
      and when at last he had under his command a force that might have been
      adequate for the Detroit expedition, he was obliged to use it in meeting a
      fresh incursion of savages which had been stirred up by the new British
      commandant on the Lakes. But Thomas Jefferson, who in 1779 succeeded Henry
      as Governor of Virginia, was deeply interested in the Detroit project, and
      at his suggestion Washington gave Clark an order on the commandant of Fort
      Pitt for guns, supplies, and such troops as could be spared. On January 
			22, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_068" id="Page_068">68</a></span>
			1781, Jefferson appointed Clark "brigadier-general of the forces to be
      embodied on an expedition westward of the Ohio." Again Clark was doomed to
      disappointment. One obstacle after another interposed. Yet as late as May,
      1781, the expectant conqueror wrote to Washington that he had "not yet
      lost sight of Detroit." Suitable opportunity for the expedition never
      came, and when peace was declared the northern stronghold was still in
      British hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clark's later days were clouded. Although Virginia gave him six thousand
      acres of land in southern Indiana and presented him with a sword, peace
      left him without employment, and he was never able to adjust himself to
      the changed situation. For many years he lived alone in a little cabin on
      the banks of the Ohio, spending his time hunting, fishing, and brooding
      over the failure of Congress to reward him in more substantial manner for
      his services. He was land-poor, lonely, and embittered. In 1818 he died a
      paralyzed and helpless cripple. His resting place is in Cave Hill
      Cemetery, Louisville; the finest statue of him stands in Monument Circle,
      Indianapolis&mdash;"an athletic figure, scarcely past youth, tall and

      The capture of Vincennes determined the fate of the Northwest. Frontier
      warfare nevertheless went steadily on. In 1779 Spain entered the contest
      as an ally of France, and it became the object of the British commanders
      on the Lakes not only to recover the posts lost to the Americans but to
      seize St. Louis and other Spanish strongholds on the west bank of the
      Mississippi. In 1780 Lieutenant-Governor Patrick Sinclair, a bustling,
      garrulous old soldier stationed at Michilimackinac, sent a force of some
      nine hundred traders, servants, and Indians down the Mississippi to
      capture both the American and Spanish settlements. An attack on St. Louis
      failed, as did likewise a series of efforts against Cahokia and Kaskaskia,
      and the survivors were glad to reach their northern headquarters again,
      with nothing to show for their pains except a dozen prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to be outdone, the Spanish commandant at St. Louis sent an expedition
      to capture British posts in the Lake country. An arduous winter march
      brought the avengers and their Indian allies to Fort St. Joseph, a mile or
      two west of the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_070" id="Page_070">70</a></span>
			present city of Niles, Michigan. It would be ungracious to say that this 
			post was selected for attack because it was without a garrison. At all 
			events, the place was duly seized, the Spanish standard was set up, and 
			possession of "the fort and its dependencies" was taken in the name of 
			his Majesty Don Carlos III. No effort was made to hold the settlement 
			permanently, and the British from Detroit promptly retook it. Probably 
			the sole intention had been to add somewhat to the strength of the 
			Spanish position at the forthcoming negotiations for peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The war in the West ended, as it began, in a carnival of butchery.
      Treacherous attacks, massacres, burnings, and pillagings were everyday
      occurrences, and white men were hardly less at fault than red. Indeed the
      most discreditable of all the recorded episodes of the time was a
      heartless massacre by Americans of a large band of Indians that had been
      Christianized by Moravian missionaries and brought together in a peaceful
      community on the Muskingum. This slaughter of the innocents at
      Gnadenh&uuml;tten ("the Tents of Grace") reveals the frontiersman at his 
			worst. But it was dearly paid for. From the Lakes to the Gulf redskins 
			rose for vengeance. Villages were wiped out, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_071" id="Page_071">71</a></span>
			and murderous bands swept far into Virginia and Pennsylvania, evading 
			fortified posts in order to fall with irresistible fury on unsuspecting 
			traders and settlers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In midsummer, 1782, news of the cessation of hostilities between Great
      Britain and her former seaboard colonies reached the back country, and the
      commandant at Detroit made an honest effort to stop all offensive
      operations. A messenger failed, however, to reach a certain Captain
      Caldwell, operating in the Ohio country, in time to prevent him from
      attacking a Kentucky settlement and bringing on the deadly Battle of Blue
      Licks, in which the Americans were defeated with a loss of seventy-one
      men. George Rogers Clark forthwith led a retaliatory expedition against
      the Miami towns, taking prisoners, recapturing whites, and destroying
      British trading establishments; and with this final flare-up the
      Revolution came to an end in the Northwest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier had won the back country for the new nation. Could the
      diplomat hold it? As early as March 19, 1779,&mdash;just three weeks after
      Clark's capture of Vincennes,&mdash;the Continental Congress formally laid
      claim to the whole of the Northwest; and a few months later John Adams 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_072" id="Page_072">72</a></span>
			was instructed to negotiate for peace on the understanding that the 
			country's northern and western boundaries were to be the line of the Great 
			Lakes and the Mississippi. When, in 1781, Franklin, Jefferson, Jay, and 
			Laurens were appointed to assist Adams in the negotiation, the new 
			Congress of the Confederation stated that the earlier instructions on 
			boundaries represented its "desires and expectations."
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been supposed that if Great Britain could be brought to
      accept these terms there would be no further difficulty. But obstacles
      arose from other directions. France had entered the war for her own
      reasons, and looked with decidedly more satisfaction on the defeat of
      Great Britain than on the prospect of a new and powerful nation in the
      Western Hemisphere. Furthermore, she was in close alliance with Spain; and
      Spain had no sympathy whatever with the American cause as such. At all
      events, she did not want the United States for a neighbor on the
      Mississippi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American commissioners were under instructions to make no peace
      without consulting France. But when, in the spring of 1782, Jay came upon
      the scene of the negotiations at Paris, he demurred. He had been for some
      time 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_073" id="Page_073">73</a></span>
			in Spain, and he carried to Paris not only a keen contempt for the
      Spanish people and Spanish politics, but a strong suspicion that Spain was
      using her influence to keep the United States from getting the territory
      between the Lakes and the Ohio. France soon fell under similar suspicion,
      for she was under obligations, as everyone knew, to satisfy Spain; and
      little time elapsed before the penetrating American diplomat was
      semiofficially assured that his suspicions in both directions were well
      founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mainspring of Spanish policy was the desire to make the Gulf of Mexico
      a closed sea, under exclusive Spanish control. This plan would be
      frustrated if the Americans acquired an outlet on the Gulf; furthermore,
      it would be jeopardized if they retained control on the upper Mississippi.
      Hence, the States must be kept back from the great river; safety dictated
      that they be confined to the region east of the Appalachians.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ingenious plan was thereupon developed. Spain was to resume possession
      of the Floridas, insuring thereby the coveted unbroken coast line on the
      Gulf. The vast area between the Mississippi and the Appalachians and south
      of the Ohio was to be an Indian territory, half under Spanish and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_074" id="Page_074">74</a></span>
			half under American "protection." The entire region north of the Ohio was 
			to be kept by Great Britain, or, at the most, divided&mdash;on lines to be
      determined&mdash;between Great Britain and the United States. From
      Rayneval, confidential secretary of the French foreign minister Vergennes,
      Jay learned that the French Government proposed to give this scheme its
      support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had such terms as these been forced on the new nation, the hundreds of
      Virginian and Pennsylvanian pioneers who had given up their lives in the
      planting of American civilization in the back country would have turned in
      their graves. But Jay had no notion of allowing the scheme to succeed. He
      sent an emissary to England to counteract the Spanish and French
      influence. He converted Adams to his way of thinking, and even raised
      doubts in Franklin's mind. Finally he induced his colleagues to cast their
      instructions to the winds and negotiate a treaty with the mother country
      independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simplified matters immensely. Great Britain was a beaten nation, and
      from the beginning her commissioners played a losing game. There was much
      haggling over the loyalists, the fisheries, debts; but the boundaries were
      quickly drawn. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_075" id="Page_075">75</a></span>
			Great Britain preferred to see the disputed western country in American 
			hands rather than to leave a chance for it to fall under the control of 
			one of her European rivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the Treaty of Paris drew the interior boundary of the new
      nation through the Great Lakes and connecting waters to the Lake of the
      Woods; from the most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods due west
      to the Mississippi (an impossible line); down the Mississippi to latitude
      31&deg;; thence east, by that parallel and by the line which is now the
      northern boundary of Florida, to the ocean. Three nations, instead of two,
      again shared the North American Continent: Great Britain kept the
      territory north of the Lakes; Spain ruled the Floridas and everything west
      of the Mississippi; the United States held the remainder&mdash;an area of
      more than 825,000 square miles, with a population of three and one half
      millions.

    <p class="noindent">
      "<span class="smcap">This</span> federal republic," wrote the Spanish 
			Count d'Aranda to his royal master in 1782, "is born a pigmy. A day will 
			come when it will be a giant, even a colossus. Liberty of conscience, the 
			facility for establishing a new population on immense lands, as well as 
			the advantages of the new government, will draw thither farmers and 
			artisans from all the nations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aranda correctly weighed the value of the country's vast stretches of free
      and fertile land. The history of the United States has been largely a
      story of the clearing of forests, the laying out of farms, the erection of
      homes, the construction of highways, the introduction of machinery, the
      building of railroads, the rise of towns and of great cities. The Germans
      of Wisconsin and Missouri, the Scandinavians of Minnesota and the Dakotas,
      the Poles and Hungarians of Chicago, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_077" id="Page_077">77</a></span>
			the Irish and Italians of a thousand communities, attest the fact that 
			the "farmers and artisans from all the nations" have had an honorable part 
			in the achievement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In laying plans for the development of the western lands the statesmanship
      of the Revolutionary leaders was at its best. In the first place, the 
			seven States which had some sort of title to tracts extending westward to 
			the Mississippi wisely yielded these claims to the nation; and thus was
      created a single, national domain which could be dealt with in accordance
      with a consistent policy. In the second place, Congress, as early as 1780,
      pledged the national Government to dispose of the western lands for the
      common benefit, and promised that they should be "settled and formed into
      distinct republican states, which shall become members of the federal
      union, and have the same rights of sovereignty, freedom, and independence
      as the other states."
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 there was mapped out a scheme
      of government admirably adapted to the liberty-loving, yet law-abiding,
      populations of the frontier. It was based on the broad principles of
      democracy, and it was sufficiently flexible to permit necessary changes as
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_078" id="Page_078">78</a></span>
      the scattered settlements developed into organized Territories and then
      into States. Geographical conditions, as well as racial inheritances,
      foreordained that the United States should be an expanding, colonizing
      nation; and it was of vital importance that wholesome precedents of
      territorial control should be established in the beginning. Louisiana,
      Florida, the Mexican accessions, Alaska, and even the newer tropical
      dependencies, owe much to the decisions that were reached in the
      organizing of the Northwest a century and a quarter ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Northwest Ordinance was remarkable in that it was framed for a
      territory that had practically no white population and which, in a sense,
      did not belong to the United States at all. Back in 1768 Sir William
      Johnson's Treaty of Fort Stanwix had made the Ohio River the boundary
      between the white and red races of the West. Nobody at the close of the
      Revolution supposed that this division would be adhered to; the Northwest
      had not been won for purposes of an Indian reserve. None the less, the
      arrangements of 1768 were inherited, and the nation considered them
      binding except in so far as they were modified from time to time by new
      agreements. The first such 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_079" id="Page_079">79</a></span>
			agreement affecting the Northwest was concluded
      in 1785, through George Rogers Clark and two other commissioners, with the
      Wyandots, Delawares, Chippewas, and Ottawas. By it the United States
      acquired title to the southeastern half of the present State of Ohio, with
      a view to surveying the lands and raising revenue by selling them.
      Successive treaties during the next thirty years gradually transferred the
      whole of the Northwest from Indian hands to the new nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Officially, the United States recognized the validity of the Indian
      claims; but the pioneer homeseeker was not so certain to do so. From about
      1775 the country south of the Ohio filled rapidly with settlers from
      Virginia and the Carolinas, so that by 1788 the white population beyond
      the Blue Ridge was believed to be considerably over one hundred thousand.
      For a decade the "Indian side," as the north shore was habitually called,
      was trodden only by occasional hunters, traders, and explorers. But after
      Clark's victories on the Mississippi and the Wabash, the frontiersmen grew
      bolder. By 1780 they began to plant camps and cabins on the rich
      bottom-lands of the Miamis, the Scioto, and the Muskingum; and when they
      heard that the British claims in 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_080" id="Page_080">80</a></span>
			the West had been formally yielded, they assumed that whatever they could 
			take was theirs. With the technicalities of Indian claims they had not 
			much patience. In 1785 Colonel Harmar, commanding at Fort Pitt, sent a 
			deputation down the river to drive the intruders back. But his agents 
			returned with the report that the Virginians and Kentuckians were moving 
			into the forbidden country "by the forties and fifties," and that they 
			gave every evidence of proposing to remain there. Surveyors were forthwith 
			set to work in the "Seven Ranges," as the tract just to the west of the 
			Pennsylvania boundary was called; and Fort Harmar was built at the mouth 
			of the Muskingum to keep the over-ardent settlers back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The close of the Revolution brought not only a swift revival of emigration
      to the West but also a remarkable outburst of speculation in western land.
      March 3, 1786, General Rufus Putnam and some other Continental officers
      met at the "Bunch of Grapes" Tavern in Boston and decided that it would be
      to their advantage to exchange for land in the Seven Ranges the paper
      certificates in which they had been paid for their military services.
      Accordingly an "Ohio Company" was organized, and Dr. Manasseh 
			Cutler&mdash;"preacher, lawyer, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_081" id="Page_081">81</a></span>
			doctor, statesman, scientist, land speculator"&mdash;was sent off
      to New York to push the matter in Congress. The upshot was that Congress
      authorized the sale of one and a half million acres east of the Scioto to
      the Ohio Company, and five million acres to a newly organized Scioto
      Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scioto Company fell into financial difficulties and, after making an
      attempt to build up a French colony at Gallipolis, collapsed. But General
      Putnam and his associates kept their affairs well in hand and succeeded in
      planting the first legal white settlement in the present State of Ohio. An
      arduous winter journey brought the first band of forty-eight settlers, led
      by Putnam himself, to the mouth of the Muskingum on April 7, 1788. Here,
      in the midst of a great forest dotted with terraces, cones, and other
      fantastic memorials of the moundbuilders, they erected a blockhouse and
      surrounded it with cabins. For a touch of the classical, they called the
      fortification the Campus Martius; to be strictly up to date, they named
      the town Marietta, after Marie Antoinette, Queen of France. In July the
      little settlement was honored by being made the residence of the newly
      arrived Governor of the Territory, General Arthur St. Clair. 
		</p>
		<p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_082" id="Page_082">82</a></span>
			Before the close of the year Congress sold one million acres between the 
			two Miamis to Judge Symmes of New Jersey; and three little towns were at 
			once laid out. To one of them a pedantic schoolmaster gave the name 
			<i>L-os-anti-ville,</i> "the town opposite the mouth of the Licking." 
			The name may have required too much explanation; at all events, when, in 
			1790, the Governor transferred the capital thither from Marietta, he 
			rechristened the place Cincinnati, in honor of the famous Revolutionary 
			society to which he belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Land speculators are confirmed optimists. But Putnam, Cutler, Symmes, and
      their associates were correct in believing that the Ohio country was at
      the threshold of a period of remarkable development. There was one serious
      obstacle&mdash;the Indians. Repeated expeditions from Kentucky had pushed
      most of the tribes northward to the headwaters of the Miami, Scioto, and
      Wabash; and the Treaty of 1785 was supposed to keep them there. But it was
      futile to expect such an arrangement to prove lasting unless steadily
      backed up with force. In their squalid villages in the swampy forests of
      northern Ohio and Indiana the redskins grew sullen and vindictive. As they
      saw their favorite hunting-grounds slipping from their grasp, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_083" id="Page_083">83</a></span>
			those who had taken part in the cession repented their generosity, while 
			those who had no part in it pronounced it fraudulent and refused to 
			consider themselves bound by it. Swiftly the idea took hold that the 
			oncoming wave must be rolled back before it was too late. "White man shall 
			not plant corn north of the Ohio" became the rallying cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back of this rebelliousness lay a certain amount of British influence. The
      Treaty of 1783 was signed in as kindly spirit as the circumstances would
      permit, but its provisions were not carried out in a charitable manner. On
      account of alleged shortcomings of the United States, the British
      Government long refused to give up possession of eight or ten fortified
      posts in the north and west. One of these was Detroit; and the officials
      stationed there systematically encouraged the hordes of redskins who had
      congregated about the western end of Lake Erie to make all possible
      resistance to the American advance. The British no longer had any claim to
      the territories south of the Lakes, but they wanted to keep their
      ascendancy over the northwestern Indians, and especially to prevent the
      rich fur trade from falling into American hands. Ammunition and other
      supplies were lavished 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_084" id="Page_084">84</a></span>
			on the restless tribes. The post officials insisted that these were merely 
			the gifts which had regularly been made in times of peace. But they were 
			used with deadly effect against the Ohio frontiersmen; and there can be 
			little doubt that they were intended so to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 1789 the situation was very serious. Marauding expeditions were growing
      in frequency; and a scout sent out by Governor St. Clair came back with
      the report that most of the Indians throughout the entire Northwest had
      "bad hearts." Washington decided that delay would be dangerous, and the
      nation forthwith prepared for its first war since independence. Kentucky
      was asked to furnish a thousand militiamen and Pennsylvania five hundred,
      and the forces were ordered to come together at Fort Washington, near
      Cincinnati.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rendezvous took place in the summer of 1790, and General Josiah Harmar
      was put in command of a punitive expedition against the Miamis. The
      recruits were raw, and Harmar was without the experience requisite for
      such an enterprise. None the less, when the little army, accompanied by
      three hundred regulars, and dragging three brass field-pieces, marched out
      of Fort Washington on a fine September day, it created a very good
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_085" id="Page_085">85</a></span>
      impression. All went well until the expedition reached the Maumee country.
      On the site of the present city of Fort Wayne they destroyed a number of
      Indian huts and burned a quantity of corn. But in a series of scattered
      encounters the white men were defeated, with a loss of nearly two hundred
      killed; and Harmar thought it the part of wisdom to retreat. He had gained
      nothing by the expedition; on the contrary, he had stirred the redskins to
      fresh aggressions, and his retreating forces were closely followed by
      bands of merciless raiders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington knew what the effect of this reverse would be. Accordingly he
      called St. Clair to Philadelphia and ordered him to take personal command
      of a new expedition, adding a special warning against ambush and surprise.
      Congress aided by voting two thousand troops for six months, besides two
      small regiments of regulars. But everything went wrong. Recruiting proved
      slow; the men who were finally brought together were poor material for an
      army, being gathered chiefly from the streets and prisons of the seaboard
      cities; and supplies were shockingly inadequate.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Clair was a man of honest intention, but old, broken in health, and of
      very limited military 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_086" id="Page_086">86</a></span>
			ability; and when finally, October 4, 1791, he led his untrained forces 
			slowly northwards from Fort Washington, he utterly failed to take measures 
			either to keep his movements secret or to protect his men against sudden 
			attack. The army trudged slowly through the deep forests, chopping out its 
			own road, and rarely advancing more than five or six miles a day. The 
			weather was favorable and game was abundant, but discontent was rife and 
			desertions became daily occurrences. As most of the men had no taste for 
			Indian warfare and as their pay was but two dollars a month, not all the 
			commander's threats and entreaties could hold them in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the 3d of November the little army&mdash;now reduced to
      fourteen hundred men&mdash;camped, with divisions carelessly scattered, on
      the eastern fork of the Wabash, about a hundred miles north of Cincinnati
      and near the Indiana border. The next morning, when preparations were
      being made for a forced march against some Indian villages near by, a
      horde of redskins burst unexpectedly upon the bewildered troops,
      surrounded them, and threatened them with utter destruction. A brave stand
      was made, but there was little chance of victory. "After the first onset," 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_087" id="Page_087">87</a></span>
			as Roosevelt has described the battle, "the Indians fought in silence, no 
			sound coming from them save the incessant rattle of their fire, as they 
			crept from log to log, from tree to tree, ever closer and closer. The 
			soldiers stood in close order, in the open; their musketry and artillery 
			fire made a tremendous noise, but did little damage to a foe they could 
			hardly see. Now and then through the hanging smoke terrible figures 
			flitted, painted black and red, the feathers of the hawk and eagle
      braided in their long scalp-locks; but save for these glimpses, the
      soldiers knew the presence of their somber enemy only from the fearful
      rapidity with which their comrades fell dead and wounded in the ranks."
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, in desperation St. Clair ordered his men to break through the
      deadly cordon and save themselves as best they could. The Indians kept up
      a hot pursuit for a distance of four miles. Then, surfeited with
      slaughter, they turned to plunder the abandoned camp; otherwise there
      would have been escape for few. As it was, almost half of the men in the
      engagement were killed, and less than five hundred got off with no injury.
      The survivors gradually straggled into the river settlements, starving and
      disheartened.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_088" id="Page_088">88</a></span>
      The page on which is written the story of St. Clair's defeat is one of the
      gloomiest in the history of the West. Harmar's disaster was dwarfed; not
      since Braddock and his regulars were cut to pieces by an unseen foe on the
      road to Fort Duquesne had the redskins inflicted upon their hereditary
      enemy a blow of such proportions. It was with a heavy heart that the
      Governor dispatched a messenger to Philadelphia with the news. Congress
      ordered an investigation; and in view of the unhappy general's high
      character and his courageous, though blundering, conduct during the late
      campaign, he was exonerated. He retained the governorship, but prudently
      resigned his military command.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was now desperate. Everywhere the forests resounded with the
      exultant cries of the victors, while the British from Detroit and other
      posts actively encouraged the belief not only that they would furnish all
      necessary aid but that England herself was about to declare war on the
      United States. Eventually a British force from Detroit actually invaded
      the disputed country and built a stockade (Fort Miami) near the site of
      the present city of Toledo, with a view to giving the redskins convincing
      evidence of the seriousness 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_089" id="Page_089">89</a></span>
			of the Great White Father's intentions. Small wonder that, when St. Clair 
			sought to obtain by diplomacy the settlement which he had failed to 
			secure by arms, his commissioners were met with the ultimatum: 
			"<em>Brothers</em>, we shall be persuaded that you mean to do us
      justice, if you agree that the Ohio shall remain the boundary line between
      us. If you will not consent thereto, our meeting will be altogether
      unnecessary."

    <p>
      It is said that Washington's first choice for the new western command was
      "Light-Horse Harry" Lee. But considerations of rank made the appointment
      inexpedient, and "Mad Anthony" Wayne was named instead. Wayne was the son
      of a Pennsylvania frontiersman and came honestly by his aptitude for
      Indian fighting. In early life he was a surveyor, and in the Revolution he
      won distinction as a dashing commander of Pennsylvania troops at
      Ticonderoga, Brandywine, Germantown, Stony Point, and other important
      engagements. Finally he obtained a major-general's commission in Greene's
      campaign in Georgia, and at the close of the war he settled in that State
      as a planter. His vanity&mdash;displayed chiefly in a love of fine 
			clothes&mdash;brought upon him a good deal of criticism; and Washington, 
			who in a Cabinet
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_090" id="Page_090">90</a></span>
      meeting characterized him as "brave and nothing else," was frankly
      apprehensive lest in the present business Wayne's impetuosity should lead
      to fresh disaster. Yet the qualities that on a dozen occasions had enabled
      Wayne to snatch success from almost certain defeat&mdash;alertness,
      decisiveness, bravery, and sheer love of hard fighting&mdash;were those
      now chiefly in demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first task was to create an army. A few regulars were available; but
      most of the three or four thousand men who were needed had to be gathered
      wheresoever they could be found. A call for recruits brought together at
      Pittsburgh, in the summer of 1792, a nondescript lot of beggars,
      criminals, and other cast-offs of the eastern cities, no better and no
      worse than the adventurers who had taken service under St. Clair. Few knew
      anything of warfare, and on one occasion a mere report of Indians in the
      vicinity caused a third of the sentinels to desert their posts. But, as
      rigid discipline was enforced and drilling was carried on for eight and
      ten hours a day, by spring the survivors formed a very respectable body of
      troops. The scene of operations was then transferred to Fort Washington,
      where fresh recruits were started on a similar course of development.
      Profitting 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_091" id="Page_091">91</a></span>
			by the experience of his predecessors, Wayne insisted that campaigning 
			should begin only after the troops were thoroughly prepared; and no 
			drill-master ever worked harder to get his charges into condition for 
			action. Going beyond the ordinary manual of arms, he taught the men to
      load their rifles while running at full speed, and to yell at the top of
      their voices while making a bayonet attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October, 1793, the intrepid Major-General advanced with twenty-six
      hundred men into the nearer stretches of the Indian country, in order to
      be in a position for an advantageous spring campaign. They built Fort
      Greenville, eighty miles north of Cincinnati, and there spent the winter,
      while, on St. Clair's fatal battle-field, an advance detachment built a
      post which they hopefully christened Fort Recovery. Throughout the winter
      unending drill was kept up; and when, in June, 1794, fourteen hundred
      mounted militia arrived from Kentucky, Wayne found himself at the head of
      the largest and best-trained force that had ever been turned against the
      Indians west of the Alleghanies. Even before the arrival of the
      Kentuckians, it proved its worth by defending its forest headquarters,
      with practically 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_092" id="Page_092">92</a></span>
			no loss, against an attack by fifteen hundred redskins.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 27th of July the army moved forward in the direction of the Maumee,
      with closed ranks and so guarded by scouts that no chance whatever was
      given for surprise attacks. Washington's admonitions had been taken to
      heart, and the Indians could only wonder and admire. News of the army's
      advance traveled ahead and struck terror through the northern villages, so
      that many of the inhabitants fled precipitately. When the troops reached
      the cultivated lands about the junction of the Maumee and Auglaize rivers,
      they found only deserted huts and great fields of corn, from which they
      joyfully replenished their diminished stores. Here a fort was built and
      given the significant name Defiance; and from it a final offer of peace
      was sent out to the hostile tribes. Never doubting that the British would
      furnish all necessary aid, the chieftains returned evasive answers. Wayne
      thereupon moved his troops to the left bank of the Maumee and proceeded
      cautiously downstream toward the British stronghold at Fort Miami.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days brought the army to a place known as Fallen Timbers, where a
      tornado had piled the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_093" id="Page_093">93</a></span>
			trunks and branches of mighty trees in indescribable confusion. The 
			British post was but five or six miles distant; and there behind the 
			breastworks which nature had provided, and in easy reach of their allies, 
			the Indians chose to make their stand. On the morning of the 20th of 
			August, Wayne, now so crippled by gout that he had to be lifted into his 
			saddle, gallantly led an assault. The Indian fire was murderous, and a 
			battalion of mounted Kentuckians was at first hurled back. But the
      front line of infantry rushed up and dislodged the savages from their
      covert, while the regular cavalry on the right charged the enemy's left
      flank. Before the second line of infantry could get into action the day
      was won. The whole engagement lasted less than three-quarters of an hour,
      and not a third of Wayne's three thousand men actually took part in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fleeing redskins were pursued to the walls of the British fort, and
      even there many were slain. The British soldiery not only utterly failed
      to come to the relief of their hard-pressed allies, but refused to open
      the gates to give them shelter. The American loss was thirty-three killed
      and one hundred wounded. But the victory was the most decisive as yet
      gained over the Indians 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_094" id="Page_094">94</a></span>
			of the Northwest. A warfare of forty years was ended in as many minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the lower Maumee, Wayne marched back to Fort Defiance, and thence to
      the junction of the St. Mary's and St. Joseph rivers, where he built a
      fort and gave it the name still borne by the thriving city that grew up
      around it&mdash;Fort Wayne. Everywhere the American soldiers destroyed the
      ripened crops and burned the villages, while the terrified inhabitants
      fled. In November the army took up winter quarters at Fort Greenville.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the Americans had the upper hand. Their arms were feared; the
      British promises of help were no longer credited by the Indians; and it
      was easy for Wayne to convince the tribal representatives who visited him
      in large numbers during the winter that their true interest was to win the
      good-will of the United States. In the summer of 1795 there was a general
      pacification. Delegation after delegation arrived at Fort Greenville,
      until more than a thousand chiefs and braves were in attendance. The
      prestige of Wayne was still further increased when the news came that John
      Jay had negotiated a treaty at London under which the British posts on
      United States soil were 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_095" id="Page_095">95</a></span>
			finally to be given up; and on August 3rd Wayne was able to announce a 
			great treaty wherein the natives ceded all of what is now southern Ohio 
			and southeastern Indiana, and numerous tracts around posts within the 
			Indian country, such as Fort Wayne, Detroit, and 
			Michilimackinac&mdash;strategic points on the western waterways. "Elder
      Brother," said a Chippewa chief in the course of one of the interminable
      harangues delivered during the negotiation, "you asked who were the true
      owners of the land now ceded to the United States. In answer, I tell you,
      if any nations should call themselves the owners of it, they would be
      guilty of falsehood; our claim to it is equal; our Elder Brother has
      conquered it." The United States duly recognized the Indian title to all
      lands not expressly ceded and promised the Indians annual subsidies. The
      terms of the treaty were faithfully observed on both sides, and for
      fifteen years the pioneer lived and toiled in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne forthwith became a national hero. Returning to Philadelphia in 1796,
      he was met by a guard of honor, hailed with the ringing of bells and a
      salute of fifteen guns, and treated to a dazzling display of fireworks.
      Congress voted its thanks, and Washington, whose fears had long 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_096" id="Page_096">96</a></span>
			since vanished, added his congratulations. There was one other service on 
			the frontier for the doughty general to render. The British posts were at 
			last to be surrendered, and Wayne was designated to receive them. By 
			midsummer he was back in the forest country, and in the autumn he took 
			possession of Detroit, amid acclamations of Indians, Americans, Frenchmen, 
			and Englishmen alike. But his work was done. On the return journey he 
			suffered a renewed attack of his old enemy, gout, and at Presqu'isle 
			(Erie) he died. A blockhouse modeled on the defenses which he built 
			during his western campaign marks his first resting-place and bears aloft 
			the flag which he helped plant in the heart of the Continent.

    <p>
      As early as 1787 an observer at Pittsburgh reported that in six weeks he
      saw fifty flatboats set off for the down-river settlements; in 1788
      forty-five hundred emigrants were said to have passed Fort Harmar between
      February and June. Most of these people were bound for Kentucky or
      Tennessee. But the census of 1790 gave the population north of the Ohio as
      4,280, and after Wayne's victory the proportion of newcomers who fixed
      their abodes in that part of the country rapidly increased. For a decade
      Ohio was the favorite goal; and within eight years after the battle at
      Fallen Timbers this region was ready for admission to the Union as a
      State. Southern Indiana also filled rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the westward movement was regarded as of no disadvantage to the
      seaboard States. It was supposed that the frontier would attract a
      population of such character as could easily be spared in more settled
      communities. But it became apparent that the new country did not appeal
      simply to broken-down farmers, bankrupts, and ne'er-do-wells. Robust and
      industrious men, with growing families, were drawn off in great 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_099" id="Page_099">99</a></span>
			numbers; and public protest was raised against the "plots to drain the 
			East of its best blood." Anti-emigration pamphlets were scattered 
			broadcast, and, after the manner of the day, the leading western 
			enterprises were belabored with much bad verse. A rude cut which gained 
			wide circulation represented a stout, ruddy, well-dressed man on a sleek 
			horse, with a label, "I am going to Ohio," meeting a pale and ghastly 
			skeleton of a man, in rags, on the wreck of what had once been a horse, 
			with the label, "I have been to Ohio."
    </p>
    <p>
      The streams of migration flowed from many sources. New England contributed
      heavily. Marietta, Cincinnati, and many other rising river towns received
      some of the best blood of that remote section. The Western Reserve&mdash;a
      tract bordering on Lake Erie which Connecticut had not ceded to the
      Federal Government&mdash;drew largely from the Nutmeg State. A month
      before Wayne set out to take possession of Detroit, Moses Cleaveland with
      a party of fifty Connecticut homeseekers started off to found a settlement
      in the Reserve; and the town which took its name from the leader was but
      the first of a score which promptly sprang up in this inviting district.
      The "Seven Ranges," lying directly south of the Reserve, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
			drew emigrants from Pennsylvania, with some from farther south. The Scioto 
			valley attracted chiefly Virginians, who early made Chillicothe their 
			principal center. In the west, and north of the Symmes tract, Kentuckians 
			poured in by the thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus in a decade Ohio became a frontier melting-pot. Puritan, Cavalier,
      Irishman, Scotch-Irishman, German&mdash;all were poured into the crucible.
      Ideals clashed, and differing customs grated harshly. But the product of a
      hundred years of cross-breeding was a splendid type of citizenship. At the
      presidential inaugural ceremonies of March 4, 1881, six men chiefly
      attracted the attention of the crowd: the retiring President, Hayes; the
      incoming President, Garfield; the Chief-Justice who administered the oath,
      Waite; the general commanding the army, William T. Sherman; the
      ex-Secretary of the Treasury, John Sherman; and "the Marshal Ney of
      America," Lieutenant-General Sheridan. Five of the six were natives of
      Ohio, and the sixth was a lifelong resident. Men commented on the striking
      group and rightly remarked that it could have been produced only by a
      singularly happy blending of the ideas and ideals that form the warp and
      woof of Americanism.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
      Amalgamation, however, took time; for there were towering prejudices and
      antipathies to be overcome. The Yankee scorned the Southerner, who
      reciprocated with a double measure of dislike. The New England settlers
      were, as a rule, people of some education; not one of their communities
      long went without a schoolmaster. They were pious, law-abiding,
      industrious; their more easy-going neighbors were likely to consider them
      over-sensitive and critical. But the quality that made most impression
      upon others was their shrewdness in business transactions. They could
      drive a bargain and could discover loopholes in a contract in a fashion to
      take the average backwoodsman off his feet. "Yankee trick" became,
      indeed, a household phrase wherever New Englander and Southerner met.
      Whether the Yankee talked or kept silent, whether he was generous or
      parsimonious, he was always under suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      What of the "Long Knives" from Virginia, the Carolinas, and Kentucky who
      also made the Ohio lands their goal? Of books they knew little; they did
      not name their settlements in honor of classic heroes. They were not
      "gentlemen"; many of them, indeed, had sought the West to escape a society
      in which distinctions of birth and possessions 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
			had put them at a disadvantage. They were not so pious as the New 
			Englanders, though they were capable of great religious enthusiasm, and 
			their morals were probably not inferior. Their houses were poorer; their 
			villages were not so well kept; their dress was more uncouth, and their 
			ways rougher. But they were a hardy folk&mdash;brave, industrious, 
			hospitable, and generous to a fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first days of westward migration the favorite gateway into the Ohio
      Valley was Cumberland Gap, at the southeastern corner of the present State
      of Kentucky. Thence the Virginians and Carolinians passed easily to the
      Ohio in the region of Cincinnati or Louisville. Later emigrants from more
      northern States found other serviceable routes. Until the opening of the
      Erie Canal in 1825, New Englanders reached the West by three main avenues.
      Some followed the Mohawk and Genesee turnpikes across central New York to
      Lake Erie. This route led directly, of course, to the Western Reserve.
      Some traveled along the Catskill turnpike from the Hudson to the
      headwaters of the Allegheny, and thence descended the Ohio. Still others
      went by boat from Boston to New York, Philadelphia, or Baltimore, in order
      to approach the Ohio by a more southerly course.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
      The natural outlet from Pennsylvania was the Ohio River. Emigrants from
      the western parts of the State floated down the Allegheny or Monongahela
      to the main stream. Those from farther east, including settlers from New
      Jersey, made the journey overland by one of several well-known roads. The
      best of these was a turnpike following the line that General Forbes had
      cut during the French and Indian War from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh by
      way of Lancaster and Bedford. Baltimore was a favorite point of departure,
      and from it the route lay almost invariably along a turnpike to Cumberland
      on the upper Potomac, and thence by the National Road across the mountains
      to Wheeling. In later days this was the route chiefly taken from Virginia,
      although more southerly passes through the Blue Ridge were used as outlets
      to the Great Kanawha, the Big Sandy, and other streams flowing into the
      Ohio farther down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the lines of westward travel which in the East spread fan-shape from
      Maine to Georgia converged on the Ohio; and that stream became, and for
      half a century remained, the great pathway of empire. Most of the
      emigrants had to cover long distances in overland travel before they
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
      reached the hospitable waterway; some, especially in earlier times, made
      the entire journey by land. Hundreds of the very poor went afoot, carrying
      all their earthly possessions on their backs, or dragging them in rude
      carts. But the usual conveyance was the canvas-covered wagon&mdash;ancestor
      of the "prairie schooner" of the western plains&mdash;drawn over the rough
      and muddy roads by four, or even six, horses. In this vehicle the
      emigrants stowed their provisions, household furniture and utensils,
      agricultural implements, looms, seeds, medicines, and every sort of thing
      that the prudent householder expected to need, and for which he could find
      space. Extra horses or oxen sometimes drew an additional load; cattle, and
      even flocks of sheep, were occasionally driven ahead or behind by some
      member of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the years of heaviest migration the highways converging on Pittsburgh
      and Wheeling were fairly crowded with westward-flowing traffic. As a rule
      several families, perhaps from the same neighborhood in the old home,
      traveled together; and in any case the chance acquaintances of the road
      and of the wayside inns broke the loneliness of the journey. There were
      wonderful things to be seen, and every day brought novel experiences. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
			But exposure and illness, dread of Indian attacks, mishaps of every sort, 
			and the awful sense of isolation and of uncertainty of the future, caused 
			many a man's stout heart to quail, and brought anguish unspeakable to 
			brave women. Of such joys and sorrows, however, is a frontier existence
      compounded; and of the growing thousands who turned their faces toward the
      setting sun, comparatively few yielded to discouragement and went back
      East. Those who did so were usually the land speculators and people of
      weak, irresolute, or shiftless character.
    </p>
    <p>
      An English traveler, Morris Birkbeck, who passed over the National Road
      through southwestern Pennsylvania in 1817, was filled with amazement at
      the number, hardihood, and determination of the emigrants whom he
      encountered.

      Arrived at the Ohio, the emigrant either engaged passage on some form of
      river-craft or set to work to construct with his own hands a vessel that
      would bear him and his belongings to the promised land. The styles of
      river-craft that appeared on the Ohio and other western streams in the
      great era of river migration make a remarkable pageant. There were canoes,
      pirogues, skiffs, rafts, dugouts, scows, galleys, arks, keelboats,
      flatboats, barges, "broadhorns," "sneak-boxes," and eventually ocean-going
      brigs, schooners, and steamboats. The canoe served the early explorer and
      trader, and even the settler whose possessions had been carried over the
      Alleghanies on a single packhorse. But after the Revolution the needs of
      an awakening 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
			empire led to the introduction of new types of craft, built to afford a 
			maximum of capacity and safety on a downward voyage, without regard for 
			the demands of a round trip. The most common of these one-way vessels 
			was the flatboat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flatboat trip down the great river was likely to be filled with
      excitement. The sound of the steam-dredge had never been heard on the
      western waters, and the stream-bed was as Nature had made it, or rather was
      continually remaking it. Yearly floods washed out new channels and formed
      new reefs and sand-bars, while logs and brush borne from the heavily
      forested banks continually built new obstructions. Consequently the
      sharpest lookout had to be maintained, and the pilot was both skilful and
      lucky who completed his trip without permitting his boat to be caught on a
      "planter" (a log immovably fixed in the river bed), entangled in the
      branches of overhanging trees, driven on an island, or dashed on the bank
      at a bend. Navigation by night and on foggy days was hazardous in the
      extreme and was avoided as far as possible. If all went well, the voyage
      from Pittsburgh to Cincinnati could be completed in six or eight days; but
      delays might easily extend the period to a month.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
      One grave danger has not been mentioned&mdash;the Indians. From the moment
      when the slow-moving flatboat passed beyond the protection of a white
      settlement, it was liable to be fired on, by day or by night, by redskins;
      and the better-built boats were so constructed as to be at least partially
      bullet-proof. Sometimes extra timber was used to give safety; sometimes
      the cargo was specially placed with that aim in view. The Indians rarely
      went beyond the water's edge. Their favorite ruse was to cause captive or
      renegade whites to run along the bank imploring to be saved. When a boat
      had been decoyed to shore, and perhaps a landing had been made, the
      savages would pour a murderous fire on the voyagers. This practice became
      so common that pioneer boats "shunned the whites who hailed them from the
      shores as they would have shunned the Indians," and as a consequence many
      whites escaping from the Indians in the interior were refused succor and
      left to die.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the flatboat reached its destination, it might find service as a
      floating store, or even as a schoolhouse. But it was likely to be broken
      up, so that the materials in it could be used for building purposes.
      Before sawmills became common, lumber 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
			was a precious commodity, and hundreds of pioneer cabins in the Ohio 
			Valley were built partly or wholly of the boards and timbers taken from 
			the flatboats of their owners. Even the "gunnels" were sometimes used in 
			Cincinnati as foundations for houses. In later days the flatboat, if in 
			reasonably good condition, was not unlikely to be sold to persons engaged 
			in trading down the Mississippi. Loaded with grain, flour, meats, and 
			other backwoods products, it would descend to Natchez or New Orleans, 
			where its cargo could be transferred to ocean-going craft. But in any case 
			its end was the same; for it would not have been profitable, even had it 
			been physically possible, to move the heavy, ungainly craft upstream over 
			long distances, in order to keep it continuously in service.

	    <p><br /></p>
		
    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">Arrived</span> on the lower Ohio, or one of its 
			tributaries, the pioneer looked
      out upon a land of remarkable riches. It was not a Mexico or a Peru, with
      emblazoned palaces and glittering temples, nor yet a California, with
      gold-flecked sands. It was merely an unending stretch of wooded hills and
      grassy plains, bedecked with majestic forests and fructifying rivers and
      lakes. It had no treasures save for the man of courage, industry, and
      patience; but for such it held home, broad acres, liberty, and the coveted
      opportunity for social equality and advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new country has been commonly thought of, and referred to by writers
      on the history of the West, as a "wilderness"; and offhand, one might
      suppose that the settlers were obliged literally to hew their way through
      densely grown vegetation to the spots which they selected for their homes.
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
      In point of fact, there were great areas of upland&mdash;not alone in the
      prairie country of northern Indiana and Illinois, but in the hilly regions
      within a hundred miles of the Ohio&mdash;that were almost treeless. On
      these unobstructed stretches grasses grew in profusion; and here roamed
      great herds of herbivorous animal-kind&mdash;deer and elk, and also
      buffalo, "filing in grave procession to drink at the rivers, plunging and
      snorting among the rapids and quicksands, rolling their huge bulk on the
      grass, rushing upon each other in hot encounter, like champions under
      shield." Along the watercourses ducks, wild geese, cranes, herons, and
      other fowl sounded their harsh cries; gray squirrels, prairie chickens,
      and partridges the hunter found at every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the forests, as a rule, were not difficult to penetrate. The
      trees stood thick, but deer paths, buffalo roads, and Indian trails
      ramified in all directions, and sometimes were wide enough to allow two or
      three wagons to advance abreast. Mighty poplars, beeches, sycamores, and
      "sugars" pushed to great heights in quest of air and sunshine, and often
      their intertwining branches were locked solidly together by a heavy growth
      of grape or other vines, producing a canopy which during the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
			summer months permitted scarcely a ray of sunlight to reach the ground. 
			There was, therefore, a notable absence of undergrowth. When a tree died 
			and decayed, it fell apart piecemeal; it was with difficulty that woodsmen 
			could wrest a giant oak or poplar from its moorings and bring it to the 
			ground, even by severing the trunk completely at the base. Here and there 
			a clean swath was cut through a forest, for perhaps dozens of miles, by a 
			hurricane. This gave opportunity for the growth of a thicket of bushes and 
			small trees, and such spots were equally likely to be the habitations of 
			wild beasts and the hiding-places of warlike bands of redskins.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were always adventurous pioneers who scorned the settlements and
      went off with their families to fix their abodes in isolated places. But
      the average newcomer preferred to find a location in, or reasonably near,
      a settlement. The choice of a site, whether by a company of immigrants
      wishing to establish a settlement or by an individual settler, was a
      matter of much importance. Some thought must be given to facilities for
      fortification against hostile natives. There must be an adequate supply of
      drinking-water; and the location of innumerable pioneer dwellings was
      selected 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
			with reference to free-flowing springs. Pasture land for immediate use was 
			desirable; and of course the soil must be fertile. As a rule, the settler 
			had the alternative of establishing himself on the lowlands along a stream 
			and obtaining ground of the greatest productiveness, with the almost 
			certain prospect of annual attacks of malaria, or of seeking the poorer 
			but more healthful uplands. The attractions of the "bottoms" were 
			frequently irresistible, and the "ague" became a feature of frontier life 
			almost as inevitable as the proverbial "death and taxes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The site selected, the next task was to clear a few acres of ground where
      the cabin was to stand. It was highly desirable to have a belt of open
      land as a protection against Indians and wild beasts; besides, there must
      be fields cleared for tillage. If the settler had neighbors, he was likely
      to have their aid in cutting away the densest growth of trees, and in
      raising into position the heavy timbers which formed the framework and
      walls of his cabin. Splendid oaks, poplars, and sycamores were cut into
      convenient lengths, and such as could not be used were rolled into great
      heaps and burned. Before sawmills were introduced lumber could not be
      manufactured; afterwards, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
			it became so plentiful as to have small market value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost without exception the frontier cabins had log walls; and they were
      rarely of larger size than single lengths would permit. On an average,
      they were twelve or fourteen feet wide and fifteen or eighteen feet long.
      Sometimes they were divided into two rooms, with an attic above;
      frequently there was but one room "downstairs." The logs were notched
      together at the corners, and the spaces between them were filled with moss
      or clay or covered with bark. Rafters were affixed to the uppermost logs,
      and to one another, with wooden pins driven through auger holes. In
      earliest times the roof was of bark; later on, shingles were used,
      although nails were long unknown, and the shingles, after being laid in
      rows, were weighted down with straight logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes there was only an earth floor. But as a rule "puncheons," 
			<i>i.e.,</i> thick, rough boards split from logs, were laid crosswise on 
			round logs and were fastened with wooden pins. There was commonly but a 
			single door, which was made also of puncheons and hung on wooden hinges. 
			A favorite device was to construct the door in upper and lower sections, 
			so as to make it possible, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
			when there came a knock or a call from the outside, to respond without 
			offering easy entrance to an unwelcome visitor. In the days when there was 
			considerable danger of Indian attacks no windows were constructed, for the 
			householder could defend only one aperture. Later, square holes which 
			could be securely barred at night and during cold weather were made to 
			serve as windows. Flat pieces of sandstone, if they could be found, were 
			used in building the great fireplace; otherwise, thick timbers heavily 
			covered with clay were made to serve. In scarcely a cabin was there a 
			trace of iron or glass; the whole could be constructed with only two 
			implements&mdash;an ax and an auger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally a family carried to its new home some treasured bits of
      furniture; but the difficulty of transportation was likely to be
      prohibitive, and as a rule the cabins contained only such pieces of
      furniture as could be fashioned on the spot. A table was made by mounting
      a smoothed slab on four posts, set in auger holes. For seats short benches
      and three-legged stools, constructed after the manner of the tables, were
      in common use. Cooking utensils, food-supplies, seeds, herbs for medicinal
      purposes, and all sorts of household 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
			appliances were stowed away on shelves, made by laying clapboards across 
			wooden pins driven into the wall and mounting to the ceiling; although 
			after sawed lumber came into use it was a matter of no great difficulty 
			to construct chests and cupboards. Not infrequently the settler's family 
			slept on bear skins or blankets stretched on the floor. But crude 
			bedsteads were made by erecting a pole with a fork in such a manner that 
			other poles could be supported horizontally in this fork and by crevices 
			in the walls. Split boards served as "slats" on which the bedding was 
			spread. For a long time "straw-ticks"&mdash;large cloth bags filled with 
			straw or sometimes dry grass or leaves&mdash;were articles of luxury. 
			Iron pots and knives were necessities which the wise householder carried 
			with him from his eastern or southern home. In the West they were hard to 
			obtain. The chief source of supply was the iron-manufacturing districts of 
			Pennsylvania and Virginia, whence the wares were carried to the 
			<i>entrep&ocirc;ts</i> of river trade by packhorses. The kitchen outfit 
			of the average newcomer was completed with a few pewter dishes, plates, 
			and spoons. But winter evenings were utilized in whittling out wooden 
			bowls, trenchers, and noggins or cups, while gourds and hard-shelled 
			squashes 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
			were turned to numerous uses. The commonest drinking utensil was a 
			long-handled gourd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dress of the pioneer long remained a curious cross between that of the
      Indians and that of the white people of the older sections. In earlier
      times the hunting-shirt&mdash;made of linsey, coarse nettle-bark linen,
      buffalo-hair, or even dressed deerskins&mdash;was universally worn by the
      men, together with breeches, leggings, and moccasins. The women and
      children were dressed in simple garments of linsey. In warm weather they
      went barefooted; in cold, they wore moccasins or coarse shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rarely was there lack of food for these pioneer families. The soil was
      prodigal, and the forests abounded in game. The <i>pi&egrave;ce de 
			r&eacute;sistance</i> of the backwoods menu was "hog an' hominy"; that 
			is to say, pork served with Indian corn which, after being boiled in lye 
			to remove the hulls, had been soaked in clear water and cooked soft. 
			"Johnny cake" and "pone"&mdash;two varieties of cornbread&mdash;were 
			regularly eaten at breakfast and dinner. The standard dish for supper 
			was cornmeal mush and milk. As cattle were not numerous, the housewife 
			often lacked milk, in which case she fell back on her one never-failing 
			resource&mdash;hominy; 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
			or she served the mush with sweetened water, molasses, the gravy of 
			fried meat, or even bear's oil. Tea and coffee were long unknown, and 
			when introduced they were likely to be scorned by the men as "slops" 
			good enough perhaps for women and children. Vegetables the settlers 
			grew in the garden plot which ordinarily adjoined the house, and thrifty 
			families had also a "truck patch" in which they raised pumpkins, 
			squashes, potatoes, beans, melons, and corn for "roasting ears." The 
			forests yielded game, as well as fruits and wild grapes, and honey for 
			sweetening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first quality for which the life of the frontier called was untiring
      industry. It was possible, of course, to eke out an existence by hunting,
      fishing, petty trading, and garnering the fruits which Nature supplied
      without man's assistance. And many pioneers in whom the roving instinct
      was strong went on from year to year in this hand-to-mouth fashion. But
      the settler who expected to be a real home-builder, to gain some measure
      of wealth, to give his children a larger opportunity in life, must be
      prepared to work, to plan, to economize, and to sacrifice. The forests had
      to be felled; the great logs had to be rolled together and burned; crops
      of maize, tobacco, oats, and cane 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
			needed to be planted, cultivated, and harvested; live stock to be housed 
			and fed; fences and barns to be built; pork, beef, grain, whiskey, and 
			other products to be prepared for market, and perhaps carried scores of 
			miles to a place of shipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things had to be done under conditions of exceptional
      difficulty. The settler never knew what night his place would be raided by
      marauding redskins, who would be lenient indeed if they merely carried off
      part of his cattle or burned his barn. Any morning he might peer out of
      the "port hole" above the cabin door to see skulking figures awaiting
      their chance. Sickness, too, was a menace and a terror. Picture the
      horrors of isolation in times of emergency&mdash;wife or child suddenly
      taken desperately ill, and no physician within a hundred miles; husband or
      son hovering between life and death as the result of injury by a falling
      tree, a wild beast, a venomous snake, an accidental gun-shot, or the
      tomahawk of a prowling Indian. Who shall describe the anxiety, the agony,
      which in some measure must have been the lot of every frontier family? The
      prosaic illnesses of the flesh were troublesome enough. On account of
      defective protection for the feet in wet weather, almost everybody had
      rheumatism; most 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
			settlers in the bottom-lands fell victims to fever and ague at one time 
			or another; even in the hill country few persons wholly escaped malarial 
			disorders. "When this home-building and land-clearing is accomplished," 
			wrote one whose recollections of the frontier were vivid, "a faithful 
			picture would reveal not only the changes that have been wrought, but a 
			host of prematurely broke-down men and women, besides an undue proportion 
			resting peacefully in country graveyards."
    </p>
    <p>
      The frontiersman's best friend was his trusty rifle. With it he defended
      his cabin and his crops from marauders, waged warfare on hostile redskins,
      and obtained the game which formed an indispensable part of his food
      supply. At first the gun chiefly used on the border was the smooth-bored
      musket. But toward the close of the eighteenth century a gunsmith named
      Deckhard, living at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, began making flintlock rifles
      of small bore, and in a short time the "Deckhard rifle" was to be found in
      the hands of almost every backwoodsman. The barrel was heavy and from
      three feet to three feet and a half in length, so that the piece, when set
      on the ground, reached at least to the huntsman's shoulder. The bore was
      cut with twisting grooves, and was so 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
			small that seventy bullets were required to weigh a pound. In loading, a 
			greased linen "patch" was wrapped around the bullet; and only a small 
			charge of powder was needed. The gun was heavy to carry and difficult to 
			hold steadily upon a target; but it was economical of ammunition, and in 
			the hands of the strong-muscled, keen-eyed, iron-nerved frontiersman it 
			was an exceedingly accurate weapon, at all events within the ordinary 
			limits of forest ranges. He was a poor marksman who could not shoot 
			running deer or elk at a distance of one hundred and fifty yards, and 
			kill ducks and geese on the wing; and "boys of twelve hung their heads in 
			shame if detected in hitting a squirrel in any other part of the body 
			than its head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Life on the frontier was filled with hard work, danger, and anxiety. Yet
      it had its lighter side, and, indeed, it may be doubted whether people
      anywhere relished sport more keenly or found more pleasure in their
      everyday pursuits. The occasional family without neighbors was likely to
      suffer from loneliness. But few of the settlers were thus cut off, and as
      a rule community life was not only physically possible but highly
      developed. Many were the opportunities that served to bring together the
      frontiersmen, with their families, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
			throughout a settlement or county. Foremost among such occasions were the 
			log-rollings.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a settler had felled the thick-growing trees on a plot which he
      desired to prepare for cultivation, he cut them, either by sawing or by
      burning, into logs twelve or fifteen feet in length. Frequently these were
      three, four, or even five feet in diameter, so that they could not be
      moved by one man, even with a team of horses. In such a situation, the
      settler would send word to his neighbors for miles around that on a given
      day there would be a log-rolling at his place; and when the day arrived
      six, or a dozen, or perhaps a score, of sturdy men, with teams of horses
      and yokes of oxen, and very likely accompanied by members of their
      families, would arrive on the scene with merry shouts of anticipation. By
      means of handspikes and chains drawn by horses or oxen, the great timbers
      were pushed, rolled, and dragged into heaps, and by nightfall the field
      lay open and ready for the plough&mdash;requiring, at the most, only the
      burning of the huge piles that had been gathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without loss of time the fires were started; and as darkness came on, the
      countryside glowed as with the light of a hundred huge torches. The 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
			skies were reddened, and as a mighty oak or poplar log toppled and fell to 
			the ground, showers of sparks lent the scene volcanic splendor. Bats and 
			owls and other dim-eyed creatures of the night flew about in bewilderment,
      sometimes bumping hard against fences or other objects, sometimes plunging
      madly into the flames and contributing to the general holocaust. For days
      the great fires were kept going, until the last remnants of this section
      of the once imposing forest were consumed; while smoke hung far out over
      the country, producing an atmospheric effect like that of Indian summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy exertion called for generous refreshment, and on these occasions the
      host could be depended on to provide an abundance of food and drink. The
      little cabin could hardly be made to accommodate so many guests, even in
      relays. Accordingly, a long table was constructed with planks and trestles
      in a shady spot, and at noon&mdash;and perhaps again in the 
			evening&mdash;the women folk served a meal which at least made up in 
			"staying qualities" what it lacked in variety or delicacy. The principal 
			dish was almost certain to be "pot-pie," consisting of boiled turkeys, 
			geese, chickens, grouse, veal, or venison, with an abundance of 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
			dumplings. This, with cornbread and milk, met the demands of the occasion; 
			but if the host was able to furnish a cask of rum, his generosity was 
			thoroughly appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the autumn, corn-huskings were a favorite form of diversion, especially
      for the young people; and in the early spring neighbors sometimes came
      together to make maple sugar. A wedding was an important event and
      furnished diversion of a different kind. From distances of twenty and
      thirty miles people came to attend the ceremony, and often the festivities
      extended over two or three days. Even now there was work to be done; for
      as a rule the neighbors organized a house-building "bee," and before
      separating for their homes they constructed a cabin for the newly wedded
      pair, or at all events brought it sufficiently near completion to be
      finished by the young husband himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after a day of heavy toil at log-rolling, the young men and boys
      bantered one another into foot races, wrestling matches, shooting
      contests, and other feats of strength or skill. And if a fiddler could be
      found, the day was sure to end with a "hoe-down"&mdash;a dance that "made
      even the log-walled house tremble." No corn-husking 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
			or wedding was complete without dancing, although members of certain of 
			the more straitlaced religious sects already frowned upon the diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rough conditions of living made rough men, and we need not be surprised by
      the testimony of English and American travelers, that the frontier had
      more than its share of boisterous fun, rowdyism, lawlessness, and crime.
      The taste for whiskey was universal, and large quantities were
      manufactured in rude stills, not only for shipment down the Mississippi,
      but for local consumption. Frequenters of the river-town taverns called
      for their favorite brands&mdash;"Race Horse," "Moral Suasion," "Vox
      Populi," "Pig and Whistle," or "Split Ticket," as the case might be. But
      the average frontiersman cared little for the niceties of color or flavor
      so long as his liquor was cheap and produced the desired effect. Hard work
      and a monotonous diet made him continually thirsty; and while ordinarily
      he drank only water and milk at home, at the taverns and at social
      gatherings he often succumbed to potations which left him in happy drunken
      forgetfulness of daily hardships. House-raisings and weddings often became
      orgies marked by quarreling and fighting 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
			and terminating in brutal and bloody brawls. Foreign visitors to the back 
			country were led to comment frequently on the number of men who had lost 
			an eye or an ear, or had been otherwise maimed in these rough-and-tumble 
			contests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great majority of the frontiersmen, however, were sober, industrious,
      and law-abiding folk; and they were by no means beyond the pale of
      religion. On account of the numbers of Scotch-Irish, Presbyterianism was
      in earlier days the principal creed, although there were many Catholics
      and adherents of the Reformed Dutch and German churches, and even a few
      Episcopalians. About the beginning of the nineteenth century sectarian
      ascendancy passed to the Methodists and Baptists, whose ranks were rapidly
      recruited by means of one of the most curious and characteristic of
      backwoods institutions, the camp-meeting "revival." The years 1799 and
      1800 brought the first of the several great waves of religious excitement
      by which the West&mdash;especially Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and 
			Tennessee&mdash;was periodically swept until within the memory of men 
			still living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camp-meetings were usually planned and managed by Methodist circuit-riders
      or Baptist itinerant 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
			preachers, who hesitated not to carry their work into the remotest and 
			most dangerous parts of the back country. When the news went abroad that 
			such a meeting was to take place, people flocked to the scene from far and 
			near, in wagons, on horseback, and on foot. Pious men and women came for 
			the sake of religious fellowship and inspiration; others not so pious came 
			from motives of curiosity, or even to share in the rough sport for which 
			the scoffers always found opportunity. The meeting lasted days, and even 
			weeks; and preaching, praying, singing, "testifying," and "exhorting" went 
			on almost without intermission. "The preachers became frantic in their 
			exhortations; men, women, and children, falling as if in catalepsy, were 
			laid out in rows. Shouts, incoherent singing, sometimes barking as of an 
			unreasoning beast, rent the air. Convulsive leaps and dancing were common; 
			so, too, 'jerking,' stakes being driven into the ground to jerk by, the 
			subjects of the fit grasping them as they writhed and grimaced in their 
			contortions. The world, indeed, seemed demented." &sup1; Whole communities 
			sometimes professed conversion; and it was considered a particularly 
			good day's work 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
			when notorious disbelievers or wrong-doers&mdash;"hard bats," in the 
			phraseology of the frontier&mdash;or gangs of young rowdies whose only 
			object in coming was to commit acts of deviltry, succumbed to the 
			peculiarly compelling influences of the occasion.

      In this sort of religion there was, of course, much wild emotionalism and
      sheer hysteria; and there were always people to whom it was repellent.
      Backsliders were numerous, and the person who "fell from grace" was more
      than likely to revert to his earlier wickedness in its grossest forms.
      None the less, in a rough, unlearned, and materialistic society such
      spiritual shakings-up were bound to yield much permanent good. Most
      western people, at one time or another, came under the influence of the
      Methodist and Baptist revivals; and from the men and women who were drawn
      by them to a new and larger view of life were recruited the hundreds of
      little congregations whose meeting-houses in the course of time dotted the
      hills and plains from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi. As for the
      hard-working, honest-minded frontier preachers who braved every sort of
      danger in the performance of their great task, the West owes them an
      eternal debt of gratitude. In the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
			words of Roosevelt, "their prejudices and narrow dislikes, their raw 
			vanity and sullen distrust of all who were better schooled than they, 
			count for little when weighed against their intense earnestness and 
			heroic self-sacrifice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was education neglected. Many of the settlers, especially those who
      came from the South, were illiterate. But all who made any pretense of
      respectability were desirous of giving their children an opportunity to
      learn to read and write. Accordingly, wherever half a dozen families lived
      reasonably close together, a log schoolhouse was sure to be found. In the
      days before public funds existed for the support of education the teachers
      were paid directly, and usually in produce, by the patrons. Sometimes a
      wandering pedagogue would find his way into a community and, being engaged
      to give instruction for two or three months during the winter, would
      "board around" among the residents and take such additional pay as he
      could get. More often, some one of the settlers who was fortunate enough
      to possess the rudiments of an education undertook the r&ocirc;le of
      schoolmaster in the interval between the autumn corn-gathering and the
      spring ploughing and planting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instruction rarely extended beyond the three R's; 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
			but occasionally a newcomer who had somewhere picked up a smattering of 
			algebra, Latin, or astronomy stirred the wonder, if not also the 
			suspicion, of the neighborhood. Schoolbooks were few and costly; crude 
			slates were made from pieces of shale; pencils were fashioned from 
			varicolored soapstone found in the beds of small streams. No frontier 
			picture is more familiar or more pleasing than that of the farmer's boy 
			sitting or lying on the floor during the long winter evening industriously 
			tracing by firelight or by candlelight the proverb or quotation assigned 
			him as an exercise in penmanship, or wrestling with the intricacies of 
			least common denominators and highest common divisors. It is in such a 
			setting that we get our first glimpse of the greatest of western 
			Americans, Abraham Lincoln.

      <span class="smcap">Wayne's</span> victory in 1795, followed by the 
			Treaty of Fort Greenville, gave the Northwest welcome relief from Indian 
			warfare, and within four years the Territory was ready to be advanced to 
			the second of the three grades of government provided for it in the 
			Ordinance of 1787. A Legislature was set up at Cincinnati, and in due 
			time it proceeded to the election of a delegate to Congress. Choice fell 
			on a young man whose name was destined to a permanent place in the 
			country's history. William Henry Harrison was the son of a signer of the 
			Declaration of Independence, the scion of one of Virginia's most honored 
			families. Entering the army in 1791, he had served as an aide-de-camp to 
			Wayne in the campaign which ended at Fallen Timbers, and at the time of 
			his election was acting as Secretary of the Territory and 
			<i>ex-officio</i> Lieutenant-Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
      Although but twenty-six years of age, and without a vote in the House of
      Representatives, Harrison succeeded in procuring from Congress in 1800 an
      act dividing the Territory into two distinct "governments," separated by
      the old Greenville treaty line as far as Fort Recovery and then by a line
      running due north to the Canadian boundary. The division to the east was
      named Ohio, that to the west Indiana; and Harrison was made Governor of
      the latter, with his residence at Vincennes. In 1802 the development of
      the back country was freshly emphasized by the admission of Ohio as a
      State.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the equilibrium between the white man and the red again became
      unstable. In the Treaty of 1795 the natives had ceded only southern Ohio,
      southeastern Indiana, and a few other small and scattered areas. Northward
      and westward, their country stretched to the Lakes and the Mississippi,
      unbroken except by military posts and widely scattered settlements; and
      title to all of this territory had been solemnly guaranteed. As late as
      1800 the white population of what is now Indiana was practically confined
      to Clark's Grant, near the falls of the Ohio, and a small region around
      Vincennes. It numbered not more than twenty-five 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
			hundred persons. But thereafter immigration from the seaboard States, and 
			from the nearer lands of Kentucky and Tennessee, set in on a new scale. 
			By 1810 Indiana had a white population of twenty-five thousand, and the 
			cabins of the energetic settlers dotted river valleys and hillsides never 
			before trodden by white man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this new rush of pioneers the rights of the Indians received scant
      consideration. Hardy and well-armed Virginians and Kentuckians broke
      across treaty boundaries and possessed themselves of fertile lands to
      which they had no valid claim. White hunters trespassed far and wide on
      Indian territory, until by 1810 great regions, which a quarter of a
      century earlier abounded in deer, bear, and buffalo, were made as useless
      for Indian purposes as barren wastes. Although entitled to the protection
      of law in his person and property, the native was cheated and overawed at
      every turn; he might even be murdered with impunity. Abraham Lincoln's
      uncle thought it a virtuous act to shoot an Indian on sight, and the
      majority of pioneers agreed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can tell at once," wrote Harrison in 1801, "upon looking at an Indian
      whom I may chance to meet whether he belongs to a neighboring or a more
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
      distant tribe. The latter is generally well-clothed, healthy, and
      vigorous; the former half-naked, filthy, and enfeebled by intoxication,
      and many of them without arms excepting a knife, which they carry for the
      most villainous purposes." The stronger tribes perceived quite as clearly
      as did the Governor the ruinous effects of contact between the two
      peoples, and the steady destruction of the border warriors became a
      leading cause of discontent. Congress had passed laws intended to prevent
      the sale of spirituous liquors to the natives, but the courts had
      construed these measures to be operative only outside the bounds of States
      and organized Territories, and in the great unorganized Northwest the laws
      were not heeded, and the ruinous traffic went on uninterrupted. Harrison
      reported that when there were only six hundred warriors on the Wabash the
      annual consumption of whiskey there was six thousand gallons, and that
      killing each other in drunken brawls had "become so customary that it was
      no longer thought criminal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Most exasperating, however, from the red man's point of view was the
      insatiable demand of the newcomers for land. In the years 1803, 1804, and
      1805 Harrison made treaties with the remnants of the Miami, Eel River,
      Piankeshaw, and Delaware 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
			tribes&mdash;characterized by him as "a body of the most depraved wretches 
			on earth"&mdash;which gained for the settlers a strip of territory fifty 
			miles wide south of White River; and in 1809 he similarly acquired, by the 
			Treaty of Fort Wayne, three million acres, in tracts which cut into the 
			heart of the Indian country for almost a hundred miles up both banks of 
			the Wabash. The Wabash valley was richer in game than any other region 
			south of Lake Michigan, and its loss was keenly felt by the Indians. 
			Indeed, it was mainly the cession of 1809 that brought once more to a 
			crisis the long-brewing difficulties with the Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the year 1768 the Creek squaw of a Shawnee warrior gave birth at one
      time to three boys, in the vicinity of the present city of Springfield,
      Ohio. &sup1; One of the three barely left his name in aboriginal annals. A
      second, known as Laulewasikaw, "the man with the loud voice," poses in the
      pages of history as "the prophet." The third brother was Tecumseh, "the
      wild-cat that leaps upon its prey," or "the shooting star," as the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
			name has been translated. He is described as a tall, handsome 
			warrior&mdash;daring and energetic, of fluent and persuasive speech, 
			given to deep reflection, an implacable hater of the white man. Other 
			qualities he possessed which were not so common among his people. He had 
			perfect self-command, a keen insight into human motives and purposes, and 
			an exceptional capacity to frame plans and organize men to carry them out. 
			His crowning scheme for bringing together the tribes of the Middle West 
			into a grand democratic confederacy to regulate land cessions and other 
			dealings with the whites stamps him as perhaps the most statesmanlike 
			member of his race.
    </p>
<div class="footer">
		<p>
        <a id="footer_8-1" name="footer_8-1"></a>
&sup1; Authorities differ as to the facts of Tecumseh's birth. His
earliest biographer, Benjamin Drake, holds that he was "wholly a
Shawanoe" and that he was a fourth child, the Prophet and another son
being twins. William Henry Harrison spoke of Tecumseh's mother as a
Creek.
    </p>
</div>
    <p>
      While yet hardly more than a boy, Tecumseh seems to have been stirred to
      deep indignation by the persistent encroachment of the whites upon the
      hunting-grounds of his fathers. The cessions of 1804 and 1805 he specially
      resented, and it is not unlikely that they clinched the decision of the
      young warrior to take up the task which Pontiac had left unfinished. At
      all events, the plan was soon well in hand. A less far-seeing leader would
      have been content to call the scattered tribes to a momentary alliance
      with a view to a general uprising against the invaders. But Tecumseh's
      purposes 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
			ran far deeper. All of the Indian peoples, of whatever name or
      relationships, from the Lakes to the Gulf and from the Alleghanies to the
      Rockies, were to be organized in a single, permanent confederacy. This
      union, furthermore, was to consist, not of chieftains, but of the
      warriors; and its governing body was to be a warriors' congress, an organ
      of genuine popular rule. Joint ownership of all Indian lands was to be
      assumed by the confederacy, and the piecemeal cession of territory by
      petty tribal chiefs, under pressure of government agents, was to be made
      impossible. Only thus, Tecumseh argued, could the red man hope to hold his
      own in the uneven contest that was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan was brilliant, even though impracticable. Naturally, it did not
      appeal instantly to the chieftains, for it took away tribal
      independence and undermined the chieftain's authority. Besides, its author
      was not a chief, and had no sanction of birth or office. Its success was
      dependent on the building of an intertribal association such as Indian
      history had never known. And while there was nothing in it which
      contravened the professed policy of the United States, it ran counter to
      the irrepressible tendency of the advancing white 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
			population to spread at will over the great western domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      By these obstacles Tecumseh was not deterred. With indefatigable zeal he
      traveled from one end of the country to the other, arguing with chiefs,
      making fervid speeches to assembled warriors, and in every possible manner
      impressing his people with his great idea. The Prophet went with him; and
      when the orator's logic failed to carry conviction, the medicine-man's
      imprecations were relied upon to save the day. Events, too, played into
      their hands. The <i>Leopard-Chesapeake</i> affair, &sup1; in 1807, roused 
			strong feeling in the West and prompted the Governor-General of Canada to 
			begin intrigues looking to an alliance with the redskins in the event of 
			war. And when, late in the same year, Governor Hull of Michigan Territory
      indiscreetly negotiated a new land cession at Detroit, the northern tribes
      at once joined Tecumseh's league, muttering threats to slay the chiefs by
      whom the cession had been sanctioned.
    </p>
<div class="footer">

Chronicles of America</i>).
    </p>
</div>
    <p>
      In the spring of 1808 Tecumseh and his brother carried their plans forward
      another step by taking up their residence at a point in central Indiana
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
      where Tippecanoe Creek flows into the Wabash River. The place&mdash;which
      soon got the name of the Prophet's Town&mdash;was almost equidistant from
      Vincennes, Fort Wayne, and Fort Dearborn; from it the warriors could
      paddle their canoes to any part of the Ohio or the Mississippi, and with
      only a short portage, to the waters of the Maumee and the Great Lakes. The
      situation was, therefore, strategic. A village was laid out, and the
      population was soon numbered by the hundred. Livestock was acquired,
      agriculture was begun, the use of whiskey was prohibited, and every
      indication was afforded of peaceful intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seasoned frontiersmen, however, were suspicious. Reports came in that the
      Tippecanoe villagers engaged daily in warlike exercises; rumor had it that
      emissaries of the Prophet were busily stirring the tribes, far and near,
      to rebellion. Governor Harrison was not a man to be easily frightened, but
      he became apprehensive, and proposed to satisfy himself by calling
      Tecumseh into conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview took place at Vincennes, and was extended over a period of
      two weeks. There was a show of firmness, yet of good will, on both sides.
      The Governor counseled peace, orderliness, and industry; the warrior guest
      professed a desire to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
			be a friend to the United States, but said frankly that if the country 
			continued to deal with the tribes singly in the purchase of land he would 
			be obliged to ally himself with Great Britain. To Harrison's admonition 
			that the redskins should leave off drinking whiskey&mdash;"that it was 
			not made for them, but for the white people, who alone knew how to use 
			it"&mdash;the visitor replied pointedly by asking that the sale of liquor 
			be stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the tenseness of the situation, Harrison negotiated the
      land cessions of 1809, which cost the Indians their last valuable
      hunting-grounds in Indiana. The powerful Wyandots promptly joined
      Tecumseh's league, and war was made inevitable. Delay followed only
      because the Government at Washington postponed the military occupation of
      the new purchase, and because the British authorities in Canada, desiring
      Tecumseh's confederacy to attain its maximum strength before the test
      came, urged the redskins to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two more years&mdash;while Great Britain and the United States hovered
      on the brink of war&mdash;preparations continued. Tribe after tribe in
      Indiana and Illinois elected Tecumseh as their chief, alliances reached to
      regions as remote as Florida. In 1810 another conference took place at
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
      Vincennes; and this time, notwithstanding Harrison's request that not more
      than thirty redskins should attend, four hundred came in Tecumseh's train,
      fully armed.
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p>
      A large portico in front of the Governor's house [says a contemporary
      account] had been prepared for the purpose with seats, as well for the
      Indians as for the citizens who were expected to attend. When Tecumseh
      came from his camp, with about forty of his warriors, he stood off, and on
      being invited by the Governor, through an interpreter, to take his seat,
      refused, observing that he wished the council to be held under the shade
      of some trees in front of the house. When it was objected that it would be
      troublesome to remove the seats, he replied that "it would only be
      necessary to remove those intended for the whites&mdash;that the red men
      were accustomed to sit upon the earth, which was their mother, and that
      they were always happy to recline upon her bosom." &sup1;

    <p>
      The chieftain's equivocal conduct aroused fresh suspicion, but he was
      allowed to proceed with the oration which he had come to deliver. Freely
      rendered, the speech ran, in part, as follows:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p>
      I have made myself what I am; and I would that I could make the red
      people as great as the conceptions of my mind, when I think of the Great
      Spirit that rules over all. I would not then come to Governor Harrison to
      ask him to tear the treaty [of 1809]; but I would say to him, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
			Brother, you have liberty to return to your own country. Once there was 
			no white man in all this country: then it belonged to red men, children 
			of the same parents, placed on it by the Great Spirit to keep it, to 
			travel over it, to eat its fruits, and fill it with the same 
			race&mdash;once a happy race, but now made miserable by the white people, 
			who are never contented, but always encroaching. They have driven us from 
			the great salt water, forced us over the mountains, and would shortly push 
			us into the lakes&mdash;but we are determined to go no further. The only 
			way to stop this evil is for all red men to unite in claiming a common 
			and equal right in the land, as it was at first, and should be 
			now&mdash;for it never was divided, but belongs to all.&hellip; 
			Any sale not made by all is not good.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      In his reply Harrison declared that the Indians were not one nation, since
      the Great Spirit had "put six different tongues in their heads," and
      argued that the Indiana lands had been in all respects properly bought
      from their rightful owners. Tecumseh's blood boiled under this denial of
      his main contention, and with the cry, "It is false," he gave a signal to
      his warriors, who sprang to their feet and seized their war-clubs. For a
      moment an armed clash was imminent. But Harrison's cool manner enabled him
      to remain master of the situation, and a well-directed rebuke sent the
      chieftain and his followers to their quarters.

      On the following morning Tecumseh apologized for his impetuosity and asked
      that the conference be renewed. The request was granted, and again the
      forest leader pressed for an abandonment of the policy of purchasing land
      from the separate tribes. Harrison told him that the question was for the
      President, rather than for him, to decide. "As the great chief is to
      determine the matter," responded the visitor grimly, "I hope the Great
      Spirit will put sense enough into his head to induce him to direct you to
      give up this land. It is true he is so far off he will not be injured by
      the war. He may sit still in his town, and drink his wine, while you and I
      will have to fight it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the clash was averted. Once more, in the summer of 1811, Tecumseh
      appeared at Vincennes, and again the deep issue between the two peoples
      was threshed out as fruitlessly as before. Announcing his purpose to visit
      the southern tribes to unite them with those of the North in a peaceful
      confederacy, the chieftain asked that during his absence all matters be
      left as they were, and promised that upon his return he would go to see
      President Madison and "settle everything with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, no pledge of the kind was given, and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
			no sooner had Tecumseh and twenty of his warriors started southward on 
			their mission to the Creeks than Harrison began preparations to end the 
			menace that had been so long hanging over the western country. Troops were 
			sent to Harrison; and volunteers were called for. As fast as volunteers 
			came in they were sent up to the Wabash to take possession of the new 
			purchase. Reinforcements arrived from Pittsburgh and from Kentucky, and 
			in a short while the Governor was able to bring together at Fort Harrison, 
			near the site of the present city of Terre Haute, twenty-four companies of 
			regulars, militia, and Indians, aggregating about nine hundred well-armed 
			men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in October this army, commanded by Harrison in person, set forth for
      the destruction of the Tippecanoe rendezvous. On the way stray redskins
      were encountered, but the advance was not resisted, and to his surprise
      Harrison was enabled to lead his forces unmolested to within a few hundred
      yards of the Prophet's headquarters. Emissaries now came saying that the
      invasion was wholly unexpected, professing peaceful intentions, and asking
      for a parley. Harrison had no idea that anything could be settled by
      negotiation, but he preferred to wait until the next day to make an
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
      attack; accordingly he agreed to a council, and the army went into camp
      for the night on an oak-covered knoll about a mile northwest of the
      village. No entrenchments were thrown up, but the troops were arranged in
      a triangle to conform to the contour of the hill, and a hundred sentinels
      under experienced officers were stationed around the camp-fires. The night
      was cold, and rain fell at intervals, although at times the moon shone
      brightly through the flying clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor was well aware of the proneness of the Indians to early
      morning attacks, so that about four o'clock on the 7th of November he rose
      to call the men to parade. He had barely pulled on his boots when the
      forest stillness was broken by the crack of a rifle at the farthest angle
      of the camp, and instantly the Indian yell, followed by a fusillade, told
      that a general attack had begun. Before the militiamen could emerge in
      force from their tents, the sentinel line was broken and the red warriors
      were pouring into the enclosure. Desperate fighting ensued, and when time
      for reloading failed, it was rifle butt and bayonet against tomahawk and
      scalping knife in hand-to-hand combat. For two hours the battle raged in
      the darkness, and only when daylight came were the troops able to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
			charge the redskins, dislodge them from behind the trees, and drive them 
			to a safe distance in the neighboring swamp. Sixty-one of Harrison's 
			officers and men were killed or mortally wounded; one hundred and
			twenty-seven others suffered serious injury. The Governor himself probably 
			owed his life to the circumstance that in the confusion he mounted a bay 
			horse instead of his own white stallion, whose rider was shot early in the
      contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian losses were small, and for twenty-four hours Harrison's forces
      kept their places, hourly expecting another assault. "Night," wrote one of
      the men subsequently, "found every man mounting guard, without food, fire,
      or light and in a drizzling rain. The Indian dogs, during the dark hours,
      produced frequent alarms by prowling in search of carrion about the
      sentinels." There being no further sign of hostilities, early on the 8th
      of November a body of mounted riflemen set out for the Prophet's village,
      which they found deserted. The place had evidently been abandoned in
      haste, for nothing&mdash;not even a fresh stock of English guns and 
			powder&mdash;had been destroyed or carried off. After confiscating 
			much-needed provisions and other valuables, Harrison ordered the village 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
			to be burned. Then, abandoning camp furniture and private baggage to make 
			room in the wagons for the wounded, he set out on the return trip to 
			Vincennes. A company was left at Fort Harrison, and the main force 
			reached the capital on the 18th of November.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the western country the news of the battle was received with
      delight, and it was fondly believed that the backbone of Tecumseh's
      conspiracy was broken. It was even supposed that the indomitable chieftain
      and his brother would be forthwith surrendered by the Indians to the
      authorities of the United States. Harrison was acclaimed as a deliverer.
      The legislatures of Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois formally thanked him
      for his services; and if, as his Federalist enemies charged, he had
      planned the whole undertaking with a view to promoting his personal
      fortunes, he ought to have been satisfied with the result. It was the
      glamour of Tippecanoe that three decades afterwards carried him into the
      President's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In precipitating a clash while Tecumseh, the master-mind of the
      fast-growing confederacy, was absent, the Prophet committed a capital
      blunder. When reproached by his warriors, he declared that all would have
      gone well but for the fact that on the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
			night before the battle his squaw had profanely touched the pot in which 
			his magic charms were brewed, so that the spell had been broken! The 
			explanation was not very convincing, and ominous murmurings were heard. 
			Before the end of the year, however, word came to Vincennes that the 
			crafty magician was back at Tippecanoe, that the village had been rebuilt, 
			and that the lives of the white settlers who were pouring into the new 
			purchase were again endangered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more alarming was the news of Tecumseh's return in January, 1812,
      from a very successful visit to the Creeks, Choctaws, and Cherokees. He
      began by asking leave to make his long-projected visit to Washington to
      obtain peace from the President, and he professed deep regret for "the
      unfortunate transaction that took place between the white people and a few
      of our young men at our village." To the British agent at Amherstburg he
      declared that had he been on the spot there would have been no fighting at
      Tippecanoe. It is reasonable to suppose that in this case there would have
      been, at all events, no Indian attack; for Tecumseh was thoroughly in
      sympathy with the British plan, which was to unite and arm the natives,
      but to prevent a premature outbreak. The chieftain's 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
			presence, however, would hardly have deterred Harrison from carrying out 
			his decision to break up the Tippecanoe stronghold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring of 1812 brought an ominous renewal of depredations. Two
      settlers were murdered within three miles of Fort Dearborn; an entire
      family was massacred but five miles from Vincennes; from all directions
      came reports of other bloody deeds. The frontier was thrown into panic. A
      general uprising was felt to be impending; even Vincennes was thought to
      be in danger. "Most of the citizens of this country," reported Harrison,
      on the 6th of May, "have abandoned their farms, and taken refuge in such
      temporary forts as they have been able to construct. Scores fled to
      Kentucky and to even more distant regions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tecumseh continued to assert his friendship for his "white brothers" and
      to treat the battle at Tippecanoe as a matter of no moment. The murders on
      the frontier he declared to be the work of the Potawatomi, who were not
      under his control, and for whose conduct he had no excuse. But it was
      noted that he made no move to follow up his professed purpose to visit
      Washington in quest of peace, and that he put forth no effort to restrain
      his over-zealous allies. It was plain enough that he 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
			was simply awaiting a signal from Canada, and that, as the commandant at 
			Fort Wayne tersely reported, if the country should have a war with Great 
			Britain, it must be prepared for an Indian war as well.

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> spring of 1812 thus found the back country 
			in a turmoil, and it was with a real sense of relief that the settlers 
			became aware of the American declaration of war against Great Britain on 
			the 18th of June. More than once Governor Harrison had asked for authority 
			to raise an army with which to "scour" the Wabash territory. In the fear 
			that such a step would drive the redskins into the arms of the British, 
			the War Department had withheld its consent. Now that the ban was lifted, 
			the people could expect the necessary measures to be taken for their 
			defense. In no part of the country was the war more popular; nowhere did 
			the mass of the able-bodied population show greater eagerness to take the 
			field.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to official returns, the Westerners were totally unprepared for
      the contest. There were but five garrisoned posts between the Ohio 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
			and the Canadian frontier. Fort Harrison had fifty men, Fort Wayne 
			eighty-five, Fort Dearborn fifty-three, Fort Mackinac eighty-eight, and 
			Detroit one hundred and twenty&mdash;a total force of fewer than four 
			hundred. The entire standing army of the United States numbered but 
			sixty-seven hundred men, and it was obvious that the trans-Alleghany 
			population would be obliged to carry almost alone the burden of their own 
			defense. The task would not be easy; for General Brock, commanding in 
			upper Canada, had at least two thousand regulars and, as soon as 
			hostilities began, was joined by Tecumseh and many hundred redskins.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the question of the war was still under debate in Congress,
      President Madison made a requisition on Ohio for twelve hundred militia,
      and in early summer the Governors of Indiana and Illinois called hundreds
      of volunteers into service. Leaving their families as far as possible
      under the protection of stockades or of the towns, the patriots flocked to
      the mustering-grounds; many, like Cincinnatus of old, deserted the plough
      in midfield. Guns and ammunition in sufficient quantity were lacking; even
      tents and blankets were often wanting. But enthusiasm ran high, and only
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
      capable leadership was needed to make of these frontier forces, once they
      were properly equipped, a formidable foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of the leaders and battles of the war in the West has been told
      in an earlier volume of this series. &sup1; It will be necessary here 
			merely to call to mind the stages through which this contest passed, as a
      preliminary to a glimpse of the conditions under which Westerners fought
      and of the new position into which their section of the country was
      brought when peace was restored. So far as the regions north of the Ohio
      were concerned, the war developed two phases. The first began with General
      William Hull's expedition from Ohio against Fort Malden for the relief of
      Detroit, and it ended with the humiliating surrender of that important
      post, together with the forced abandonment of Forts Dearborn and Mackinac,
      so that the Wabash and Maumee became, for all practical purposes, the
      country's northern boundary. This was a story of complete and bitter
      defeat. The second phase began likewise with a disaster&mdash;the needless
      loss of a thousand men on the Raisin River, near Detroit. Yet it succeeded
      in bringing William 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
			Henry Harrison into chief command, and it ended in
      Commodore Perry's signal victory on Lake Erie and Harrison's equally
      important defeat of the disheartened British land forces on the banks of
      the Thames River, north of the Lake. At this Battle of the Thames perished
      Tecumseh, who in point of fact was the real force behind the British
      campaigns in the West. Tradition describes him on the eve of the battle
      telling his comrades that his last day had come, solemnly stripping off
      his British uniform before going into battle, and arraying himself in the
      fighting costume of his own people.

</div>
    <p>
      For two-thirds of the time, the war went badly for the Westerners, and
      only at the end did it turn out to be a brilliant success. The reasons for
      the dreary succession of disasters are not difficult to discover. Foremost
      among them is the character of the troops and officers. The material from
      which the regiments were recruited was intrinsically good, but utterly raw
      and untrained. The men could shoot well; they had great powers of
      endurance; and they were brave. But there the list of their military
      virtues ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scheme of military organization relied upon throughout the West was
      that of the volunteer 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
			militia. In periods of ordinary Indian warfare the
      system served its purpose fairly well. Under stern necessity, the
      self-willed, independence-loving backwoodsmen could be brought to act
      together for a few weeks or months; but they had little systematic
      training, and their impatience of restraint prevented the building up of
      any real discipline. There were periodic musters for company or regimental
      drill. But, as a rule, drill duty was not taken seriously. Numbers of men
      failed to report; and those who came were likely to give most of their
      time to horse-races, wrestling-matches, shooting contests&mdash;not to
      mention drinking and brawling&mdash;which turned the occasion into mere
      merrymaking or disorder. The men brought few guns, and when drills were
      actually held these soldiers in the making contented themselves with
      parading with cornstalks over their shoulders. "Cornstalk drill" thus
      became a frontier epithet of derision. It goes without saying that these
      troops were poorly officered. The captains and colonels were chosen by the
      men, frequently with more regard for their political affiliations or their
      general standing in the community than for their capacity as military
      commanders; nor were the higher officers, appointed by the chief executive
      of territory, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
			state, or nation, more likely to be chosen with a view to their military 
			fitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came about, as Roosevelt has said, that the frontier people of the
      second generation "had no military training whatever, and though they
      possessed a skeleton militia organization, they derived no benefit from
      it, because their officers were worthless, and the men had no idea of
      practising self-restraint or obeying orders longer than they saw fit." 
			&sup1; When the War of 1812 began, these backwoods troops were pitted 
			against British regulars who were powerfully supported by Indian allies. 
			The officers of these untrained American troops were, like Hull, pompous,
      broken-down, political incapables; while to the men themselves may fairly
      be applied Amos Kendall's disgusted characterization of a Kentucky muster:
      "The soldiers are under no more restraint than a herd of swine. Reasoning,
      remonstrating, threatening, and ridiculing their officers, they show their
      sense of equality and their total want of subordination." Not until the
      very last of the war, when under Harrison's direction capable and
      experienced officers drilled them into real soldiers, did these backwoods
      stalwarts become an effective fighting force.

      There were also shortcomings of another sort. None was more exasperating
      or costly than the lack of means of transportation. Even in Ohio, the
      oldest and most settled portion of the Northwest, roads were few and poor;
      elsewhere there were practically none of any kind. But the regions in
      which the war was carried on were far too sparsely populated to be able to
      furnish the supplies, even the foodstuffs, needed by the troops; and
      materials of every sort had to be transported from the East, by river,
      lake, and wilderness trail. Up and down the great unbroken stretches
      between the Ohio and the Lakes moved the floundering supply trains in the
      vain effort to keep up with the armies, or to reach camps or forts in time
      to avert starvation or disaster. Pack-horses waded knee-deep in mud;
      wagons were dragged through mire up to their hubs; even empty vehicles
      sometimes became so embedded that they had to be abandoned, the drivers
      being glad to get off with their horses alive. Many times a quartermaster,
      taking advantage of a frost, would send off a convoy of provisions, only
      to hear of its being swamped by a thaw before reaching its destination.
      One of the tragedies of the war was the suffering of the troops while
      waiting for supplies of clothing, tents, medicines, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
			and food which were stuck in swamps or frozen up in rivers or lakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beset with pleurisy, pneumonia, and rheumatism in winter, with fevers in
      summer, and subject to attack by the Indians at all times, these frontier
      soldiers led an existence of exceptional hardship. Only the knowledge that
      they were fighting for their freedom and their homes held them to their
      task. An interesting sidelight on the conditions under which their work
      was done is contained in the following extract from a letter written by a
      volunteer in 1814:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
		<p>
      On the second day of our march a courier arrived from General Harrison,
      ordering the artillery to advance with all possible speed. This was
      rendered totally impossible by the snow which took place, it being a
      complete swamp nearly all day. On the evening of the same day news arrived
      that General Harrison had retreated to Portage River, eighteen miles in
      the rear of the encampment at the rapids. As many men as could be spared
      determined to proceed immediately to re-enforce him.&hellip; At two 
			o'clock the next morning our tents were struck, and in half an hour we 
			were on the road. I will candidly confess that on that day I regretted 
			being a soldier. On that day we marched thirty miles under an incessant 
			rain; and I am afraid you will doubt my veracity when I tell you that in 
			eight miles of the best of the road, it took us over the knees, and often 
			to the middle. The Black Swamp would have been considered 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
			impassable by all but men determined to surmount every difficulty to 
			accomplish the object of their march. In this swamp you lose sight of 
			<i>terra firma</i> altogether&mdash;the water was about six inches deep 
			on the ice, which was very rotten, often breaking through to the depth 
			of four or five feet. The same night we encamped on very wet ground, 
			but the driest that could be found, the rain still continuing. It was 
			with difficulty we could raise fires; we had no tents; our clothes were 
			wet, no axes, nothing to cook with, and very little to eat. A brigade 
			of pack-horses being near us, we procured from them some flour, killed 
			a hog (there were plenty of <em>them</em> along the road); our bread was 
			baked in the ashes, and our pork we broiled on the coals&mdash;a
      sweeter meal I never partook of. When we went to sleep it was on two logs
      laid close to each other, to keep our bodies from the damp ground. Good
      God! What a pliant being is man in adversity. &sup1;

      The principal theater of war was the Great Lakes and the lands adjacent to
      them. Prior to the campaign which culminated in Jackson's victory at New
      Orleans after peace had been signed, the Mississippi Valley had been
      untrodden by British soldiery. The contest, none the less, came close home
      to the backwoods populations. Scores of able-bodied men from every
      important community saw months or years of toilsome service; many failed
      to return to their homes, or else returned 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
			crippled, weakened, or stricken with fatal diseases; crops were neglected, 
			or had only such care as could be given them by old men and boys; trade 
			languished; Indian depredations wrought further ruin to life and property 
			and kept the people continually in alarm. Until 1814, reports of 
			successive defeats, in both the East and West, had a depressing influence 
			and led to solemn speculation as to whether the back country stood in 
			danger of falling again under British dominion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, therefore, with a very great sense of relief that the West heard
      in 1815 that peace had been concluded. At a stroke both the British menace
      and the danger from the Indians were removed; for although the redskins
      were still numerous and discontented, their spirit of resistance was
      broken. Never again was there a general uprising against the whites; never
      again did the Northwest witness even a local Indian war of any degree of
      seriousness save Black Hawk's Rebellion in 1832. Tecumseh manifestly
      realized before he made his last stand at the Thames that the cause of his
      people was forever lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several years the unsettled conditions on the frontiers had restrained
      any general migration thither from the seaboard States. But within a 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
			few months after the proclamation of peace the tide again set westward, 
			and with an unprecedented force. Men who had suffered in their property or
      other interests from the war turned to Indiana and Illinois as a promising
      field in which to rebuild their fortunes. The rapid extinction of Indian
      titles opened up vast tracts of desirable land, and the conditions of
      purchase were made so easy that any man of ordinary industry and integrity
      could meet them. Speculators and promoters industriously advertised the
      advantages of localities in which they were interested, boomed new towns,
      and even loaned money to ambitious emigrants.
    </p>

      The upshot was that the population of Indiana grew from twenty-five
      thousand in 1810 to seventy thousand in 1816, when the State was admitted
      to the Union. Illinois filled with equal rapidity, and attained statehood
      only two years later. Then the tide swept irresistibly westward across the
      Mississippi into the great regions which had been acquired from France in
      1803. As late as 1812 the Territory of Missouri, comprising all of the
      Louisiana Purchase north of the present State of Louisiana, had a
      population of only twenty-two thousand, including many French and Spanish
      settlers and traders. But in 1818 it had a population 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
			of more than sixty thousand, and was asking Congress for legislation under 
			which the most densely inhabited portion should be set off as the State of 
			Missouri. Thus the Old Northwest was not merely losing its frontier 
			character and taking its place in the nation on a footing with the 
			seaboard sections; it was also serving as the open gateway to a newer, 
			vaster, and in some respects richer American back country.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the main, southern Indiana and Illinois&mdash;as well as the
      trans-Mississippi territory&mdash;drew from Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia,
      and the remoter South. North of the latitude of Indianapolis and St. Louis
      the lines of migration led chiefly from New England, New York, and
      Pennsylvania. But many of the settlers came, immediately or after only a
      brief interval, from Europe. The decade following the close of the war was
      a time of unprecedented emigration from England, Scotland, Ireland, and
      Germany to the United States; and while many of the newcomers found homes
      in the eastern States, where they in a measure offset the depopulation
      caused by the westward exodus, a very large proportion pressed on across
      the mountains in quest of the cheap lands in the undeveloped interior.
      During these years the western country was repeatedly 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
			visited by European travelers with a view to ascertaining its resources, 
			markets, and other attractions for settlers; and emigration thither was 
			powerfully stimulated by the writings of these observers, as well as by 
			the activities of sundry founders of agricultural colonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These favorable accounts," wrote Adlard Welby, an Englishman who made a
      tour of inspection through the West in 1819, "aided by a period of real
      privation and discontent in Europe, caused emigration to increase ten-fold;
      and though various reports of unfavorable nature soon circulated, and many
      who had emigrated actually returned to their native land in disgust, yet
      still the trading vessels were filled with passengers of all ages and
      descriptions, full of hope, looking forward to the West as to a land of
      liberty and delight&mdash;a land flowing with milk and honey&mdash;a
      second land of Canaan." &sup1;

    <p>
      After the dangers from the Indians were overcome, the main obstacle to
      western development was the lack of means of easy and cheap
      transportation. The settler found it difficult to reach the region which
      he had selected for his home. Eastern supplies of salt, iron, hardware,
      and fabrics and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
			foodstuffs could be obtained only at great expense. The
      fast-increasing products of the western farms&mdash;maize, wheat, meats,
      livestock&mdash;could be marketed only at a cost which left a slender
      margin of profit. The experiences of the late war had already proved the
      need of highways as auxiliaries of national defense. It required a month
      to carry goods from Baltimore to central Ohio. None the less, even before
      the War of 1812, hundreds of transportation companies were running
      four-horse freight wagons between the eastern and western States; and in
      1820 more than three thousand wagons&mdash;practically all carrying
      western products&mdash;passed back and forth between Philadelphia and
      Pittsburgh, transporting merchandise valued at eighteen million dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small wonder that western producer and eastern dealer alike became
      interested in internal improvements; or that under the double stimulus of
      private and public enterprise Indian trails fast gave way to rough pioneer
      roadways, and they to carefully planned and durable turnpikes. Long before
      the War of 1812, Jefferson, Gallatin, Clay, and other statesmen had
      conceived of a great highway, or series of highways, connecting the
      seaboard with the interior as the surest and best means of promoting
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
      national unity and strength; and, in the act of Congress of 1802 admitting
      the State of Ohio, a promising beginning had been made by setting aside
      five per cent of the money received from the sale of public lands in the
      State for the building of roads extending eastward to the navigable waters
      of Atlantic streams. In 1808 Secretary Gallatin had presented to Congress
      a report calling for an outlay on internal improvements of two million
      dollars of federal money a year for ten years; and in 1811 the Government
      had entered upon the greatest undertaking of its kind in the history of
      the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      This enterprise was the building of the magnificent highway known to the
      law as the Cumberland Road, but familiar to uncounted emigrants,
      travelers, and traders&mdash;and deeply embedded in the traditions of the
      Middle States and the West&mdash;as the National Road. Starting at
      Cumberland, Maryland, this great artery of commerce and travel was pushed
      slowly through the Alleghanies, even in the dark days of the war, and by
      1818 it was open for traffic as far west as Wheeling. The method of
      construction was that which had lately been devised by John McAdam in
      England, and involved spreading crushed limestone over a carefully
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
      prepared road-bed in three layers, traffic being permitted for a time over
      each layer in succession. This "macadamized" surface was curved to permit
      drainage, and extra precautions were taken in localities where spring
      freshets were likely to cause damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Controversy raged over proposals to extend the road to the farthest West,
      to provide its upkeep by a system of tolls, and to build similar highways
      farther north and south. But for a time constitutional and legal
      difficulties were swept aside and construction continued. Columbus was
      reached in 1833, Indianapolis about 1840; and the roadway was graded to
      Vandalia, then the capital of Illinois, and marked out to Jefferson City,
      Missouri, although it was never completed to the last-mentioned point by
      federal authority. When one reads that the original cost of construction
      mounted to $10,000 a mile in central Pennsylvania, and even $13,000 a mile
      in the neighborhood of Wheeling, one's suspicion is aroused that public
      contracts were not less dubious a hundred years ago than they have been
      known to be in our own time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The National Road has long since lost its importance as the great
      connecting link of East and West. But in its day, especially before 1860,
      it 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
			was a teeming thoroughfare. Its course was lined with hospitable
      farmhouses and was dotted with fast-growing villages and towns. Some of
      the latter which once were nationally famed were left high and dry by
      later shifts of the lines of traffic, and have quite disappeared from the
      map. Throughout the spring and summer months there was a steady westward
      stream of emigrants; hardly a day failed to bring before the observer's
      eye the creaking canvas-covered wagon of the homeseeker. Singly and in
      companies they went, ever toward the promised land. Wagon-trains of
      merchandise from the eastern markets toiled patiently along the way.
      Speculators, peddlers, and sightseers added to the procession, and in
      hundreds of farmhouses the women-folk and children gathered in interested
      groups by the evening fire to hear the chance visitor talk politics or war
      and retail with equal facility the gossip of the next township and that of
      Washington or New York. Great stage-coach lines&mdash;the National Road
      Stage Company, the Ohio National Stage Company, and others&mdash;advertised
      the advantages of their services and sought patronage with all the
      ingenuity of the modern railroad. Taverns and roadhouses of which no trace
      remains today offered entertainment at any figure, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
			and of almost any character, that the customer desired. Eastward flowed a 
			steady stream of wagon-trains of flour, tobacco, and pork, with great 
			droves of cattle and hogs to be fattened for the Philadelphia or 
			Baltimore markets.
    </p>
    <p>
      At almost precisely the same time that the first shovelful of earth was
      turned for the Cumberland Road, people dwelling on the banks of the upper
      Ohio were startled by the spectacle of a large boat moving majestically
      down stream entirely devoid of sail, oar, pole, or any other visible means
      of propulsion or control. This object of wonderment was the 
			<i>New Orleans,</i> the first steamboat to be launched on western waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conquest of the steamboat was speedy and complete. Already in 1819
      there were sixty-three such craft on the Ohio, and in 1834&mdash;when the
      total shipping tonnage of the Atlantic seaboard was 76,064, and of the
      British Empire 82,696&mdash;the tonnage afloat on the Ohio and Mississippi
      was 126,278. Vessels regularly ascended the navigable tributaries of the
      greater streams in quest of cargoes, and while craft of other sorts did
      not disappear, the great and growing commerce of the river was
      revolutionized.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the upbuilding of steamboat navigation 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
			the thriving, bustling, boastful spirit of the West found ample play. 
			Steamboat owners vied with one another in adorning their vessels with 
			bowsprits, figureheads, and all manner of tinseled decorations, and in 
			providing elegant accommodations for passengers; engineers and pilots 
			gloried in speed records and challenged one another to races which ended 
			in some of the most shocking steamboat disasters known to history. The 
			unconscious bombast of an anonymous Cincinnati writer in Timothy Flint's 
			<i>Western Monthly Review</i> in 1827 gives us the real flavor of the 
			steamboat business on the threshold of the Jacksonian era:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p>
      An Atlantic cit, who talks of us under the name of backwoodsmen, would
      not believe, that such fairy structures of oriental gorgeousness and
      splendor as the <i>Washington</i>, the <i>Florida</i>, the <i>Walk in 
			the Water</i>, <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>, etc., etc., had ever existed 
			in the imaginative brain of a romancer, much less, that they were 
			actually in existence, rushing down the Mississippi, as on the wings of 
			the wind, or plowing up between the forests, and walking against the 
			mighty current "as things of life," bearing speculators, merchants, 
			dandies, fine ladies, everything real, and everything affected, in the 
			form of humanity, with pianos, and stocks of novels, and cards, and dice, 
			and flirting, and love-making, and drinking, and champagne, and on the 
			deck, perhaps, three hundred fellows, who have seen alligators, and 
			neither fear 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
			whiskey, nor gun-powder. A steamboat, coming from New Orleans, brings to 
			the remotest villages of our streams, and the very doors of the cabins, 
			a little Paris, a section of Broadway, or a slice of Philadelphia, to 
			ferment in the minds of our young people, the innate propensity for 
			fashions and finery.&hellip; Cincinnati will soon be the centre of the 
			"celestial empire," as the Chinese say; and instead of encountering the 
			storms, the seasickness, and dangers of a passage from the Gulf of Mexico 
			to the Atlantic, whenever the Erie Canal shall be completed, the opulent 
			southern planters will take their families, their dogs and parrots, 
			through a world of forests, from New Orleans to New York, giving us a 
			call by the way. When they are more acquainted with us, their voyage will 
			often terminate here. &sup1;

      The new West was frankly materialistic. Yet its interests were by no means
      restricted to steamboats, turnpikes, crops, exports, and money-making. It
      concerned itself much with religion. One of the most familiar figures on
      trail and highway was the circuit-rider, with his Bible and saddlebags;
      and no community was so remote, or so hardened, as not to be raised
      occasionally to a frenzy of religious zeal by the crude but terrifying
      eloquence of the revivalist. For education, likewise, there was a growing
      regard. Nowhere did the devotion of the Western people to the twin 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
			ideas of democracy and enlightenment find nobler expression than in the 
			clause of the Indiana constitution of 1816 making it the duty of the 
			Legislature to provide for "a general system of education, ascending in a 
			regular gradation from township schools to a state university, wherein 
			tuition shall be gratis, and equally open to all." This principle found 
			general application throughout the Northwest. By 1830 common schools 
			existed wherever population was sufficient to warrant the expense; 
			academies and other secondary schools were springing up in Cincinnati, 
			Louisville, St. Louis, and many lesser places; state universities existed 
			in Ohio and Indiana; and Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians had begun 
			to dot the country with small colleges. Literature developed slowly. But 
			newspapers appeared almost before there were readers; and that the new 
			society was by no means without cultural, and even &aelig;sthetic, 
			aspiration is indicated by the long-continued rivalry of Cincinnati and 
			Lexington, Kentucky, to be known as "the Athens of the West."

    <p class="noindent">
      <span class="smcap">The</span> War of 1812 did much in America 
			to stimulate national pride and to foster a sense of unity. None the less, 
			the decade following the Peace of Ghent proved the beginning of a long 
			era in which the point of view in politics, business, and social life was 
			distinctly sectional. New England, the Middle States, the South, the 
			West&mdash;all were bent upon getting the utmost advantages from their 
			resources; all were viewing public questions in the light of their 
			peculiar interests. In the days of Clay and Calhoun and Jackson the 
			nation's politics were essentially a struggle for power among the 
			sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a time when the frontier folk of the trans-Alleghany country
      from Lakes to Gulf were much alike. New Englanders in the Reserve,
      Pennsylvanians in central Ohio, Virginians and Carolinians in Kentucky and
      southern Indiana, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
			Georgians in Alabama and Mississippi, Kentuckians and Tennesseeans in 
			Illinois and Missouri&mdash;all were pioneer farmers and stock-raisers, 
			absorbed in the conquest of the wilderness and all thinking, working, and 
			living in much the same way.  But by 1820 the situation had altered. 
			The West was still a "section," whose interests and characteristics 
			contrasted sharply with those of New England or the Middle States. Yet 
			upon occasion it could act with very great effect, as for instance when 
			it rallied to the support of Jackson and bore him triumphantly to the 
			presidential chair. Great divergences, however, had grown up within this 
			western area; differences which had existed from the beginning had been 
			brought into sharp relief. Under play of climatic and industrial forces, 
			the West had itself fallen apart into sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foremost was the cleavage between North and South, on a line marked
      roughly by the Ohio River. Climate, soil, the cotton gin, and slavery
      combined to make of the southern West a great cotton-raising area,
      interested in the same things and swayed by the same impulses as the
      southern seaboard. Similarly, economic conditions combined to make of the
      northern West a land of small 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
			farmers, free labor, town-building, and diversified manufactures and 
			trade. A very large chapter of American history hinges on this wedging 
			apart of Southwest and Northwest. To this day the two great divisions 
			have never wholly come together in their ways of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither of these western segments was itself entirely a unit. The
      Northwest, in particular, had been settled by people drawn from every
      older portion of the country, and as the frontier receded and society took
      on a more matured aspect, differences of habits and ideas were accentuated
      rather than obscured. Men can get along very well with one another so long
      as they live apart and do not try to regulate their everyday affairs on
      common lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great human streams that poured into the Northwest flowed from two
      main sources&mdash;the nearer South and New England. Ohio, Indiana, and
      Illinois were first peopled by men and women of Southern stock. Some
      migrated directly from Virginia, the Carolinas, and even Georgia. But most
      came from Kentucky and Tennessee and represented the second generation of
      white people in those States, now impelled to move on to a new frontier by
      the desire for larger and cheaper farms. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
			Included in this Southern element were many representatives of the 
			well-to-do classes, who were drawn to the new territories by the 
			opportunity for speculation in land and for political preferment, and by 
			the opening which the fast-growing communities afforded for lawyers, 
			doctors, and members of other professions. The number of these would have 
			been larger had there been less rigid restrictions upon slaveholding. It 
			was rather, however, the poorer whites&mdash;the more democratic, 
			non-slaveholding Southern element&mdash;that formed the bulk of the 
			earlier settlers north of the Ohio.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much westward migration from New England before the War of 1812,
      but only a small share of it reached the Ohio country, and practically
      none went beyond the Western Reserve. The common goal was western New
      York. Here again there was some emigration of the well-to-do and
      influential. But, as in the South, the people who moved were mainly those
      who were having difficulty in making ends meet and who could see no way of
      bettering their condition in their old homes. The back country of Maine,
      New Hampshire, Vermont, and western Massachusetts was filled with people
      of this sort&mdash;poor, discontented, restless, without political
      influence, and needing 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
			only the incentive of cheap lands in the West to sever the slender ties 
			which bound them to the stony hillsides of New England.
    </p>
    <p>
      After 1815 New England emigration rose to astonishing proportions, and an
      increasing number of the homeseekers passed&mdash;directly or after a
      sojourn in the Lower Lake country of New York&mdash;into the Northwest.
      The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 made the westward journey easier and
      cheaper. The routes of travel led to Lakes Ontario and Erie, thence to the
      Reserve in northern Ohio, thence by natural stages into other portions of
      northern Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and eventually into southern
      Michigan and Wisconsin. Not until after 1830 did the stalwart homeseekers
      penetrate north of Detroit; the great stretches of prairie between Lakes
      Erie and Michigan, and to the south&mdash;left quite untouched by Southern
      pioneers&mdash;satisfied every desire of these restless farmers from New
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time Southerners determined the course of history in the Old
      Northwest. They occupied the field first, and they had the great advantage
      of geographical proximity to their old homes. Furthermore, they lived more
      compactly; the New Englanders were not only spread 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
			over the broader prairie stretches of the north, but scattered to some 
			extent throughout the entire region between the Lakes and the Ohio. &sup1; 
			But by the middle of the century not only had the score of northern 
			counties been inundated by the "Yankees" but the waves were pushing far 
			into the interior, where they met and mingled with the counter-current. 
			Both Illinois and Indiana became, in a pre&euml;minent degree, 
			melting-pots in which was fused by slow and sometimes painful processes 
			an amalgam which Bryce and other keen observers have pronounced the most 
			American thing in America.

<div class="footer">

        <a id="footer_10-1" name="footer_10-1"></a>
&sup1; In 1820 the population of Indiana was confined almost entirely
to the southern third of the State, although the removal of the capital,
in 1825, from Corydon to Indianapolis was carried out in the confidence
that eventually that point would become the State's populational as it
was its geographical center. When, in 1818, Illinois was admitted to
the Union its population was computed at 40,000. The figure was probably
excessive; at all events, contemporaries testify that so eager were the
people for statehood that many were counted twice, and even emigrants
were counted as they passed through the Territory. But the census
of 1820 showed a population of 55,000, settled almost wholly in the
southern third of the State, with narrow tongues of inhabited land
stretching up the river valleys toward the north. Two slave States
flanked the southern end of the commonwealth; almost half of its area
lay south of a westward prolongation of Mason and Dixon's line. Save for
a few Pennsylvanians, the people were Southern; the State was for all
practical purposes a Southern State. As late as 1833 the Legislature
numbered fifty-eight members from the South, nineteen from the Middle
States, and only four from New England.
    </p>

		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
      Of the great national issues in the quarter-century following the War of
      1812 there were some upon which people of the Northwest, in spite of their
      differing points of view, could very well agree. Internal improvement was
      one of these. Roads and canals were necessary outlets to southern and
      eastern markets, and any reasonable proposal on this subject could be
      assured of the Northwest's solid support. The thirty-four successive
      appropriations to 1844 for the Cumberland Road, Calhoun's "Bonus Bill" of
      1816, the bill of 1822 authorizing a continuous national jurisdiction over
      the Cumberland Road, the comprehensive "Survey Bill" of 1824, the
      Maysville Road Bill of 1830&mdash;all were backed by the united strength
      of the Northwestern senators and representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      So with the tariff. The cry of the East for protection to infant
      industries was echoed by the struggling manufacturers of Cincinnati,
      Louisville, and other towns; while a protective tariff as a means of
      building up the home market for foodstuffs and raw materials seemed to the
      Westerner an altogether reasonable and necessary expedient. Ohio alone in
      the Northwest had an opportunity to vote on the protective bill of 1816,
      and gave its enthusiastic support. Ohio, Indiana, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
			and Illinois voted unitedly for the bills of 1820, 1824, 1828, and 1832. 
			The principal western champion of the protective policy was Henry Clay, 
			a Kentuckian; but the Northwest supported the policy more consistently 
			than did Clay's own State and section.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the National Bank the position of the Northwest was no less emphatic.
      The people were little troubled by the question of constitutionality; but
      believing that the bank was an engine of tyranny in the hands of an
      eastern aristocracy, they were fully prepared to support Jackson in his
      determination to extinguish that "un-American monopoly."
    </p>

      There were other subjects upon which agreement was reached either with
      difficulty or not at all. One of these was the form of local government
      which should be adopted. Southerners and New Englanders brought to their
      new homes widely differing political usages. The former were accustomed to
      the county as the principal local unit of administration. It was a
      relatively large division, whose affairs were managed by elective
      officers, mainly a board of commissioners. The New Englanders, on the
      other hand, had grown up under the town-meeting system and clung to 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
			the notion that an indispensable feature of democratic local government is 
			the periodic assembling of the citizens of a community for legislative,
      fiscal, and electoral purposes. The Illinois constitution of 1818 was made
      by Southerners, and naturally it provided for the county system. But
      protest from the "Yankee" elements became so strong that in the new
      constitution of 1848 provision was made for township organization wherever
      the people of a county wanted it; and this form of government, at first
      prevalent only in the northern counties, is now found in most of the
      central and southern counties as well.

    <p>
      The most deeply and continuously dividing issue in the Northwest, as in
      the nation at large, was negro slavery. Although written by Southern men,
      the Ordinance of 1787 stipulated that there should be "neither slavery nor
      involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the
      punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted." If
      the government of the Northwest had been one of laws, and not of men, this
      specific provision would have made the territory free soil and would have
      relieved the inhabitants from all interest in the "peculiar institution."
      But the laws never execute themselves&mdash;least 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
			of all in frontier communities. In point of fact, considerable numbers of 
			slaves were held in the territory until the nineteenth century was far 
			advanced. As late as 1830 thirty-two negroes were held in servitude in the 
			single town of Vincennes. Slavery could and did prevail to a limited 
			extent because existing property rights were guaranteed in the Ordinance 
			itself, in the deed of cession by Virginia, in the Jay Treaty of 1794, and 
			in other fundamental acts. The courts of the Northwest held that 
			slave-owners whose property could be brought under any of these guarantees 
			might retain that property; and although no court countenanced further 
			importation, itinerant Southerners&mdash;"rich planters traveling in their 
			family carriages, with servants, packs of hunting-dogs, and trains of 
			slaves, their nightly camp-fires lighting up the wilderness where so 
			recently the Indian hunter had held possession"&mdash;occasionally settled 
			in southern Indiana or Illinois and with the connivance of the authorities 
			kept some of their dependents in slavery, or quasi-slavery, for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of actual slaveholders there were not enough to influence public sentiment
      greatly. But the people of Southern extraction, although neither 
			slaveholders 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
			nor desiring to become such, had no strong moral convictions on
      the subject. Indeed, they were likely to feel that the anti-slavery
      restriction imposed an unfortunate impediment in the way of immigration
      from the South. Hence the persistent demand of citizens of Indiana and
      Illinois for a relaxation of the drastic prohibition of slavery in the
      Ordinance of 1787. In 1796 Congress was petitioned from Kaskaskia to
      extend relief; in 1799 the territorial Legislature was urged to bring
      about a repeal; in 1802 an Indiana territorial convention at Vincennes
      memorialized Congress in behalf of a suspension of the proviso for a
      period of ten years. Not only were violations of the law winked at, but
      both Indiana and Illinois deliberately built up a system of indenture
      which partook strongly of the characteristics of slavery. After much
      controversy, Indiana, in 1816, framed a state constitution which
      reiterated the language of the Northwest Ordinance, but without
      invalidating titles to existing slave property; while Illinois was
      admitted to the Union in 1818 with seven or eight hundred slaves upon her
      soil, and with a constitution which continued the old system of indenture
      with slight modification.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a heated contest in Illinois in 1824 over the 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
			question of calling a
      state convention to draft a constitution legalizing slavery the people of
      Northern antecedents made their votes tell and defeated the project. But,
      like other parts of the Northwest, this State never became a unit on the
      slavery issue. Certainly it never became abolitionist. By an almost
      unanimous vote the Legislature, in 1837, adopted joint resolutions which
      condemned abolitionism as "more productive of evil than of moral and
      political good"; and in Congress in the preceding year the delegation of
      the State had given solid support to the "gag resolutions," which were
      intended to deny a hearing to all petitions on the slavery question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the great era of slavery controversy the Northwest was prolific
      of schemes of compromise, for the constant clash of Northern and Southern
      elements developed an aptitude for settlement by agreement on moderate
      lines. The people of the section as a whole long clung to popular, or
      "squatter," sovereignty as the supremely desirable solution of the slavery
      question&mdash;a device formulated and defended by two of the Northwest's
      own statesmen, Cass and Douglas, and relinquished only slowly and
      reluctantly under the leadership, not of a New England abolitionist, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
			but of a statesman of Southern birth who had come to the conclusion that 
			the nation could not permanently exist half slave and half free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cass, Douglas, Lincoln&mdash;all were adopted sons of the Northwest, and
      the career of every one illustrates not only the prodigality with which
      the back country showered its opportunities upon men of industry and
      talent, but the play and interplay of sectional and social forces in the
      building of the newer nation. Cass and Douglas were New Englanders. One
      was born at Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1782; the other at Brandon, Vermont,
      in 1813. Lincoln sprang from Virginian and Kentuckian stocks. His father's
      family moved from Virginia to Kentucky at the close of the Revolution; in
      1784 his grandfather was killed by lurking Indians, and his father, then a
      boy of six, was saved from captivity only by a lucky shot of an older
      brother. Lincoln himself was born in 1809. Curiously enough, Cass and
      Douglas, the New Englanders, played their r&ocirc;les on the national 
			stage as Jackson Democrats, while Lincoln, the Kentuckian of Virginian 
			ancestry, became a Whig and later a Republican.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cass and Douglas were well-born. Cass's father was a thrifty
      soldier-farmer who made for his 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
			family a comfortable home at Zanesville, Ohio; Douglas's father was a 
			successful physician. Lincoln was born in obscurity and wretchedness. His 
			father, Thomas Lincoln, was a ne'er-do-well Kentucky carpenter, grossly 
			illiterate, unable or unwilling to rise above the lowest level of 
			existence in the pioneer settlements. His mother, Nancy Hanks, whatever 
			her antecedents may have been, was a woman of character, and apparently of 
			some education. But she died when her son was only nine years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cass and Douglas had educational opportunities which in their day were
      exceptional. Both attended famous academies and received instruction in
      the classics, mathematics, and philosophy. Both grew up in an environment
      of enlightenment and integrity. Lincoln, on the other hand, got a few
      weeks of instruction under two amateur teachers in Kentucky and a few
      months more in Indiana&mdash;in all, hardly as much as one year; and as a
      boy he knew only rough, coarse surroundings. When, in 1816, the restless
      head of the family moved from Kentucky to southern Indiana, his worldly
      belongings consisted of a parcel of carpenters' tools and cooking
      utensils, a little bedding, and about four hundred gallons of whiskey. No
      one who has 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
			not seen the sordidness, misery, and apparent hopelessness of
      the life of the "poor whites" even today, in the Kentucky and southern
      Indiana hills, can fully comprehend the chasm which separated the boy
      Lincoln from every sort of progress and distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three men prepared for public life by embracing the profession that
      has always, in this country, proved the surest avenue to preferment&mdash;the
      law. But, whereas Cass arrived at maturity just in time to have an active
      part in the War of 1812, and in this way to make himself the most logical
      selection for the governorship of the newly organized Michigan Territory,
      Douglas saw no military service, and Lincoln only a few weeks of service
      during the Black Hawk War, and both were obliged to seek fame and fortune
      along the thorny road of politics. Following admission to the bar at
      Jacksonville, Illinois, in 1834, Douglas was elected public prosecutor of
      the first judicial circuit in 1835; elected to the state Legislature in
      1836; appointed by President Van Buren registrar of the land office at
      Springfield in 1837; made a judge of the supreme court of the State in
      1841; and elected to the national House of Representatives in 1843.
      Resourceful, skilled in debate, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
			intensely patriotic, and favored with many winning personal qualities, he 
			drew to himself men of both Northern and Southern proclivities and became 
			an influential exponent of broad and enduring nationalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, after a first defeat, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois
      Legislature in 1834, and again in 1836. When he gathered all of his
      worldly belongings in a pair of saddle-bags and fared forth to the new
      capital, Springfield, to settle himself to the practice of law, he had
      more than a local reputation for oratorical power; and events were to
      prove that he had not only facility in debate and familiarity with public
      questions, but incomparable devotion to lofty principles. In the
      subsequent unfolding of the careers of Lincoln and Douglas&mdash;especially
      in the turn of events that brought to each a nomination for the presidency
      by a great party in 1860&mdash;there was no small amount of good luck and
      sheer accident. But it is equally true that by prodigious effort
      Kentuckian and Vermonter alike hewed out their own ways to greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the glory of the Northwest to offer a competence to the needy, the
      baffled, the discouraged, the tormented of the eastern States and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
			of Europe. The bulk of its fast-growing population consisted, it is true, 
			of ordinary folk who could have lived on in fair comfort in the older
      sections, yet who were ambitious to own more land, to make more money, and
      to secure larger advantages for their children. But nowhere else was the
      road for talent so wide open, entirely irrespective of inheritance,
      possessions, education, environment. Nowhere outside of the
      trans-Alleghany country would the rise of a Lincoln have been possible.

				 <p class="chaptertitle">The Upper Mississippi Valley</p>		
      </div>
	    <p><br /></p>
		
    <p>
      <span class="smcap">While</span> the Ohio country&mdash;the lower half 
			of the States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois&mdash;was throwing off its 
			frontier character, the remoter Northwest was still a wilderness 
			frequented only by fur-traders and daring explorers. And that far 
			Northwest by the sources of the Mississippi had been penetrated by few 
			white men since the seventeenth century. The earliest white visitors to 
			the upper Mississippi are not clearly known. They may have been Pierre 
			Radisson and his brother-in-law, M&eacute;nard des Grosseilliers, who are 
			alleged to have covered the long portage from Lake Superior to the 
			Mississippi in or about 1665; but the matter rests entirely on how one 
			interprets Radisson's vague account of their western perambulations. At 
			all events, in 1680&mdash;seven years after the descent of the river from 
			the Wisconsin to the Arkansas by Marquette and Joliet&mdash;Louis 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
			Hennepin, under instructions from La Salle, explored the stream from the 
			mouth of the Illinois to the Falls of St. Anthony, where the city of 
			Minneapolis now stands, five hundred miles from the true source.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the matter of exploration rested until the days of Thomas Jefferson,
      when the purchase of Louisiana lent fresh interest to northwestern
      geography. In 1805 General James Wilkinson, in military command in the
      West, dispatched Lieutenant Zebulon M. Pike with a party of twenty men
      from St. Louis to explore the headwaters of the great river, make peace
      with the Indians, and select sites for fortified posts. From his winter
      quarters near the Falls, Pike pushed northward over the snow and ice
      until, early in 1806, he reached Leech Lake, in Cass County, Minnesota,
      which he wrongly took to be the source of the Father of Waters. It is
      little wonder that, at a time when the river and lake surfaces were frozen
      over and the whole country heavily blanketed with snow, he should have
      found it difficult to disentangle the maze of streams and lakes which fill
      the low-lying region around the headwaters of the Mississippi, the Red
      River, and the Lake of the Woods. In 1820 General Cass, Governor of
      Michigan, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
			which then had the Mississippi for its western boundary, led an
      expedition into the same region as far as Cass Lake, where the Indians
      told him that the true source lay some fifty miles to the northwest. It
      remained for the traveler and ethnologist Henry Schoolcraft, twelve years
      later, to discover Lake Itasca, in modern Clearwater County, which
      occupies a depression near the center of the rock-rimmed basin in which
      the river takes its rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not these infrequent explorers, however, who opened paths for
      pioneers into the remote Northwest, but traders in search of furs and
      pelts&mdash;those commercial pathfinders of western civilization. There is
      scarcely a town or city in the State of Wisconsin that does not owe its
      origin, directly or indirectly, to these men. Cheap and tawdry enough were
      the commodities bartered for these wonderful beaver and otter 
			pelts&mdash;ribbons and gewgaws, looking-glasses and combs, blankets and 
			shawls of gaudy color. But scissors and knives, gunpowder and shot, 
			tobacco and whiskey, went also in the traders' packs, though traffic in 
			fire-water was forbidden. These goods, upon arrival at Mackinac, were sent 
			out by canoes and <i>bateaux</i> to the different posts, where they were 
			dealt out to the savages directly or were dispatched 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
			to the winter camps along the far-reaching waterways. "Returning home 
			in the spring, the bucks would set their squaws and children at making 
			maple-sugar or planting corn, watermelons, potatoes, and squash, while 
			they themselves either dawdled their time away or hunted for summer furs. 
			In the autumn, the wild rice was garnered along the sloughs and the river 
			mouths, and the straggling field crops were gathered in&mdash;some of the 
			product being hidden in skillfully covered pits, as a reserve, and some 
			dried for transportation in the winter's campaign. The villagers were now 
			ready to depart for their hunting-grounds, often hundreds of miles away. 
			It was then that the trader came and credits were wrangled over and 
			extended, each side endeavoring to get the better of the other." &sup1;

</div>
    <p>
      This traffic was largely managed by the British in Canada until 1816, when
      an act of Congress forbade foreign traders to operate on United States
      soil. But a heavier blow was inflicted in the establishment of John Jacob
      Astor's American Fur Company, which was given a substantial monopoly of
      Indian commerce. From its headquarters on Mackinac Island this great
      corporation rapidly 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
			squeezed the clandestine British agents out of the American trade, 
			introduced improved methods, and built up a system which covered the 
			entire fur-bearing Northwest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this remoter Northwest, the region between Lakes Erie and Michigan was
      the most accessible from the East; yet it was avoided by the first
      pioneers, who labored under a strange misapprehension about its climate
      and resources. In spite of the fact that it abounded in rich bottom-lands
      and fertile prairies and was destined to become one of the most bountiful
      orchards of the world, it was reported by early prospectors to be swampy
      and unfit for cultivation. Though Governor Cass did his best to overcome
      this prejudice, for years settlers preferred to gather mainly about
      Detroit, leaving the rich interior to fur-traders. When enlightenment
      eventually came, population poured in with a rush. Detroit&mdash;which was
      a village in 1820&mdash;became ten years later a thriving city of thirty
      thousand and the western terminus of a steamboat line from Buffalo, which
      year after year multiplied its traffic. By the year 1837 the great
      territory lying east of Lake Michigan was ready for statehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost simultaneously the region to the west 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
			of Lake Michigan began to emerge from the fur-trading stage. The place of 
			the picturesque trader, however, was not taken at once by the prosaic 
			farmer. The next figure in the pageant was the miner. The presence of 
			lead in the stretch of country between the Wisconsin and Illinois rivers 
			was known to the Indians before the coming of the white man, but they 
			began to appreciate its value only after the introduction of firearms by 
			the French. The ore lay at no great depth in the Galena limestone, and 
			the aborigines collected it either by stripping it from the surface or 
			by sinking shallow shafts from which it was hoisted in deerskin bags. 
			Shortly after the War of 1812 American prospectors pushed into the region, 
			and the Government began granting leases on easy terms to operators. In 
			1823 one of these men arrived with soldiers, supplies, skilled miners, 
			and one hundred and fifty slaves; and thereafter the "diggings" fast 
			became a mecca for miners, smelters, speculators, merchants, gamblers, 
			and get-rich-quick folk of every sort, who swarmed thither by thousands 
			from every part of the United States, especially the South, and even from 
			Europe. "Mushroom towns sprang up all over the district; deep-worn native 
			paths became ore 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
			roads between the burrows and the river-landings; sink-holes abandoned by 
			the Sauk and Foxes, when no longer to be operated with their crude tools, 
			were reopened and found to be exceptionally rich, while new diggings and
      smelting-furnaces, fitted out with modern appliances, fairly dotted the
      map of the country." &sup1;

      Galena was the entrep&ocirc;t of the region. A trail cut thither from 
			Peoria soon became a well-worn coach road; roads were early opened to 
			Chicago and Milwaukee. In 1822 Galena was visited by a Mississippi River 
			steamboat, and a few years later regular steamboat traffic was 
			established. And it was by these roadways and waterways that homeseekers 
			soon began to arrive.

      The invasion of the white man, accompanied though it was by treaties, was
      bitterly resented by the Indian tribes who occupied the Northwest above
      the Illinois River. These Sioux, Sauk and Foxes, and Winnebagoes, with
      remnants of other tribes, carried on an intermittent warfare for years,
      despite the efforts of the Federal Government to define tribal boundaries;
      and between red men and white men coveting the same lands causes of
      irritation 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
			were never wanting. In 1827 trouble which had been steadily
      brewing came to the boiling-point. Predatory expeditions in the north were
      reported; the Winnebagoes were excited by rumors that another war between
      the United States and Great Britain was imminent; an incident or even an
      accident was certain to provoke hostilities. The incident occurred. When
      Red Bird, a petty Winnebago chieftain dwelling in a "town" on the Black
      River, was incorrectly informed that two Winnebago braves who had been
      imprisoned at Prairie du Chien had been executed, he promptly instituted
      vengeance. A farmer's family in the neighborhood of Prairie du Chien was
      massacred, and two keel-boats returning down stream from Fort Snelling
      were attacked, with some loss of life. The settlers hastily repaired the
      old fort and also dispatched messengers to give the alarm. Galena sent a
      hundred militiamen; a battalion came down from Fort Snelling; Governor
      Cass arrived on the spot by way of Green Bay; General Atkinson brought up
      a full regiment from Jefferson Barracks, near St. Louis; and finally Major
      Whistler proceeded up the Fox with a portion of the troops stationed at
      Fort Howard, on Green Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
      When all was in readiness, the Winnebagoes were notified that, unless Red
      Bird and his principal accomplice, Wekau, were promptly surrendered, the
      tribe would be exterminated. The threat had its intended effect, and the
      two culprits duly presented themselves at Whistler's camp on the
      Fox-Wisconsin portage, in full savage regalia, and singing their war
      dirges. Red Bird, who was an Indian of magnificent physique and lofty
      bearing, had but one request to make&mdash;that he be not committed to
      irons&mdash;and this request was granted. At Prairie du Chien, whither the
      two were sent for trial, he had opportunities to escape, but he refused to
      violate his word by taking advantage of them. Following their trial, the
      redskins were condemned to be hanged. Unused to captivity, however, Red
      Bird languished and soon died, while his accomplice was pardoned by
      President Adams. In 1828 Fort Winnebago was erected on the site of Red
      Bird's surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Winnebagoes now agreed to renounce forever their claims to the lead
      mines. Furthermore, in the same year, the site of the principal Sauk
      village and burying-ground, on Rock River, three miles south of the
      present city of Rock Island, was sold by the Government, and the Sauk and
      Foxes 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
			resident in the vicinity were given notice to leave. Under the Sauk
      chieftain Keokuk most of the dispossessed warriors withdrew peacefully
      beyond the Mississippi, and two years later the tribal representatives
      formally yielded all claims to lands east of that stream. Some members of
      the tribe, however, established themselves on the high bluff which has
      since been known as Black Hawk's Watch Tower and defied the Government to
      remove them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leading spirit in this protest was Black Hawk, who though neither born
      a chief nor elected to that dignity, had long been influential in the
      village and among his people at large. During the War of 1812 he became an
      implacable enemy of the Americans, and, after fighting with the British at
      the battles of Frenchtown and the Thames, he returned to Illinois and
      carried on a border warfare which ended only with the signing of a special
      treaty of peace in 1816. For years thereafter he was accustomed to lead
      his "British band" periodically across northern Illinois and southern
      Michigan to the British Indian agency to receive presents of arms,
      ammunition, provisions, and trinkets; and he was a principal intermediary
      in the British intrigues which gave Cass, as superintendent 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
			of Indian affairs in the Northwest, many uneasy days. He was ever a 
			restless spirit and a promoter of trouble, although one must admit that 
			he had some justice on his side and that he was probably honest and 
			sincere. Tall, spare, with pinched features, exceptionally high 
			cheekbones, and a prominent Roman nose, he was a figure to command 
			attention&mdash;the more so by reason of the fact that he had practically 
			no eyebrows and no hair except a scalp-lock, in which on state occasions 
			he fastened a flaming bunch of dyed eagle feathers.

    <p>
      Returning from their hunt in the spring of 1830, Black Hawk and his
      warriors found the site of their town pre&euml;mpted by white settlers and
      their ancestral burying-ground ploughed over. In deep rage, they set off
      for Malden, where they were liberally entertained and encouraged to rebel.
      Coming again to the site of their village a year later, they were
      peremptorily ordered away. This time they resolved to stand their ground,
      and Black Hawk ordered the squatters themselves to withdraw and gave them
      until the middle of the next day to do so. Black Hawk subsequently
      maintained that he did not mean to threaten bloodshed. But the settlers so
      construed his command 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
			and deluged Governor Reynolds with petitions for help. With all possible 
			speed, sixteen hundred volunteers and ten companies of United States 
			regulars were dispatched to the scene, and on the 25th of June, they 
			made an impressive demonstration within view of the village. In the face 
			of such odds discretion seemed the better part of valor, and during the 
			succeeding night Black Hawk and his followers quietly paddled across the 
			Mississippi. Four days later they signed an agreement never to return to 
			the eastern banks without express permission from the United States 
			Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Indian side this compact was not meant to be kept. Against the
      urgent advice of Keokuk and other leaders, Black Hawk immediately began
      preparations for a campaign of vengeance. British intrigue lent stimulus,
      and a crafty "prophet," who was chief of a village some thirty-five miles
      up the Rock, made it appear that aid would be given by the Potawatomi,
      Winnebagoes, and perhaps other powerful peoples. In the first week of
      April, 1832, the disgruntled leader and about five hundred braves, with
      their wives and children, crossed the Mississippi at Yellow Banks and
      ascended the Rock River to the prophet's town, with 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
			a view to raising a crop of corn during the summer and taking the 
			war-path in the fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invasion created much alarm throughout the frontier country. The
      settlers drew together about the larger villages, which were put as
      rapidly as possible in a state of defense. Again the Governor called for
      volunteers, and again the response more than met the expectation. Four
      regiments were organized, and to them were joined four hundred regulars.
      One of the first persons to come forward with an offer of his services was
      a tall, ungainly, but powerful young man from Sangamon County, who had but
      two years before settled in the State, and who was at once honored with
      the captaincy of his company. This man was Abraham Lincoln. Other men
      whose names loom large in American history were with the little army also.
      The commander of the regulars was Colonel Zachary Taylor. Among his
      lieutenants were Jefferson Davis and Albert Sidney Johnston, and Robert
      Anderson, the defender of Fort Sumter in 1860, was a colonel of Illinois
      volunteers. It is said that the oath of allegiance was administered to
      young Lincoln by Lieutenant Jefferson Davis!
    </p>
    <p>
      Over marshy trails and across streams swollen 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
			by the spring thaws the army advanced to Dixon's Ferry, ninety miles up 
			the Rock, whence a detachment of three hundred men was sent out, under 
			Major Stillman, to reconnoitre. Unluckily, this force seized three 
			messengers of peace dispatched by Black Hawk and, in the clash which 
			followed, was cut to pieces and driven into headlong flight by a mere 
			handful of red warriors. The effect of this unexpected affray was both 
			to stiffen the Indians to further resistance and to precipitate a fresh 
			panic throughout the frontier. All sorts of atrocities ensued, and Black 
			Hawk's name became a household bugaboo the country over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally a new levy was made ready and sent north. Pushing across the
      overflowed wilderness stretches, past the sites of modern Beloit and
      Madison, this army, four thousand strong, came upon the fleeing enemy on
      the banks of the Wisconsin River, and at Wisconsin Heights, near the
      present town of Prairie du Sac, it inflicted a severe defeat upon the
      Indians. Again Black Hawk desired to make peace, but again he was
      frustrated, this time by the lack of an interpreter. The redskins' flight
      was continued in the direction of the Mississippi, which they reached in
      midsummer. 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
			They were prevented from crossing by lack of canoes, and finally the 
			half-starved band found itself caught between the fire of a force of 
			regulars on the land side and a government supply steamer, the 
			<i>Warrior,</i> on the water side, and between these two the Indian 
			band was practically annihilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ended the war&mdash;a contest originating in no general uprising or
      far-reaching plan, such as marked the rebellions instigated by Pontiac and
      Tecumseh, but which none the less taxed the strength of the border
      populations and opened a new chapter in the history of the remoter
      northwestern territories. Black Hawk himself took refuge with the
      Winnebagoes in the Dells of the Wisconsin, only to be treacherously
      delivered over to General Street at Prairie du Chien. Under the terms of a
      treaty of peace signed at Fort Armstrong (Rock Island) in September, the
      fallen leader and some of his accomplices were held as hostages, and
      during the ensuing winter they were kept at Jefferson Barracks (St. Louis)
      under the surveillance of Jefferson Davis. In the spring of 1833 they were
      taken to Washington, where they had an interview with President Jackson.
      "We did not expect to conquer the whites," Black Hawk told the President;
      "they had too many houses, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
			too many men. I took up the hatchet, for my part, to revenge injuries 
			which my people could no longer endure. Had I borne them longer without 
			striking, my people would have said, 'Black Hawk is a woman&mdash;he is 
			too old to be a chief&mdash;he is no Sauk.'" After a brief imprisonment 
			at Fortress Monroe, where Jefferson Davis was himself confined at the 
			close of the Civil War, the captives were set free, and were taken to 
			Philadelphia, New York, up the Hudson, and finally back to the Rock River 
			country.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some years Black Hawk lived quietly on a small reservation near Des
      Moines. In 1837 the peace-loving Keokuk took him with a party of Sauk and
      Fox chiefs again to Washington, and on this trip he made a visit to
      Boston. The officials of the city received the august warrior and his
      companions in Faneuil Hall, and the Governor of the commonwealth paid them
      similar honor at the State House. Some war-dances were performed on the
      Common for the amusement of the populace, and afterwards the party was
      taken to see a performance by Edwin Forrest at the Tremont Theatre. Here
      all went well, except that at an exciting point in the play where one of
      the characters fell dying the Indians burst out into a war-whoop, 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
			to the considerable consternation of the women and children present.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months after returning to his Iowa home, Black Hawk, now seventy-one
      years of age, was gathered to his fathers. He was buried about half a mile
      from his cabin, in a sitting posture, his left hand grasping a cane
      presented to him by Henry Clay, and at his side a supply of food and
      tobacco sufficient to last him to the spirit land, supposed to be three
      days' travel. "Rock River," he said in a speech at a Fourth of July
      celebration shortly before his death, "was a beautiful country. I liked my
      town, my cornfields, and the home of my people. I fought for it. It is now
      yours. Keep it, as we did. It will produce you good crops."
    </p>
		<hr class="break" />
		
    <p>
      The Black Hawk War opened a new chapter in the history of the Northwest.
      The soldiers carried to their homes remarkable stories of the richness and
      attractiveness of the northern country, and the eastern newspapers printed
      not only detailed accounts of the several expeditions but highly colored
      descriptions of the charms of the region. Books and pamphlets by the score
      helped to attract the attention of the country. The result 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
			was a heavy influx of settlers, many of them coming all the way from New 
			England and New York, others from Pennsylvania and Ohio. Lands were 
			rapidly surveyed and placed on sale, and surviving Indian hunting-grounds 
			were purchased. Northern Illinois filled rapidly with a thrifty farming 
			population, and the town of Chicago became an entrep&ocirc;t. Further 
			north, Wisconsin had been organized, in 1836, as a Territory, including 
			not only the present State of that name but Iowa, Minnesota, and most of 
			North and South Dakota. As yet the Iowa country, however, had been 
			visited by few white people; and such as came were only hunters and 
			trappers, agents of the American Fur and other trading companies, or 
			independent traders. Two of the most active of these free-lances of 
			early days&mdash;the French Canadian Dubuque and the Englishman 
			Davenport&mdash;have left their names to flourishing cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      To recount the successive purchases by which the Government freed Iowa
      soil from Indian domination would be wearisome. The Treaty of 1842 with
      the Sauks and Foxes is typical. After a sojourn of hardly more than a
      decade in the Iowa country, these luckless folk were now persuaded to
      yield all their lands to the United States and retire 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
			to a reservation in
      Kansas. The negotiations were carried out with all due regard for Indian
      susceptibilities. Governor Chambers, resplendent in the uniform of a
      brigadier-general of the United States army, repaired with his aides to
      the appointed rendezvous, and there the chiefs presented themselves,
      arrayed in new blankets and white deerskin leggings, with full
      paraphernalia of paint, feathers, beads, and elaborately decorated war
      clubs. Oratory ran freely, although through the enforced medium of an
      interpreter. The chiefs harangued for hours not only upon the beautiful
      meadows, the running streams, the stately trees, and the other beloved
      objects which they were called upon to surrender to the white man, but
      upon the moon and stars and rain and hail and wind, all of which were
      alleged to be more attractive and beneficent in Iowa than anywhere else.
      The Governor, in turn, gave the Indians some good advice, urging them to
      live peaceably in their new homes, to be industrious and self-supporting,
      to leave liquor alone, and, in general, to "be a credit to the country."
      When every one had talked as much as he liked, the treaty was solemnly
      signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "New Purchase" was thrown open to settlers in the following spring;
      and the opening 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
			brought scenes of a kind destined to be re&euml;nacted scores of times in 
			the great West during succeeding decades&mdash;the borders of the new 
			district lined, on the eve of the opening, with encamped settlers and 
			their families ready to race for the best claims; horses saddled and
      runners picked for the rush; a midnight signal from the soldiery,
      releasing a flood of eager land-hunters armed with torches, axes, stakes,
      and every sort of implement for the laying out of claims with all possible
      speed; by daybreak, many scores of families "squatting" on the best pieces
      of ground which they had been able to reach; innumerable disputes, with a
      general readjustment following the intervention of the government
      surveyors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marvelous progress of the upper Mississippi Valley is briefly told by
      a succession of dates. In 1838 Iowa was organized as a Territory; in 1846
      it was admitted as a State; in 1848 Wisconsin was granted statehood; and
      in 1849 Minnesota was given territorial organization with boundaries
      extending westward to the Missouri.
    </p>
		<hr class="break" />
		
    <p>
      Thus the Old Northwest had arrived at the goal set for it by the
      large-visioned men who framed the Ordinance of 1787; every foot of its
      soil was included 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
			in some one of the five thriving, democratic commonwealths that had taken 
			their places in the Union on a common basis with the older States of the 
			East and the South. Furthermore, the Mississippi had ceased to be a 
			boundary. A magnificent vista reaching off to the remoter West and 
			Northwest had been opened up; the frontier had been pushed far out upon 
			the plains of Minnesota and Iowa. Decade after decade the powerful epic 
			of westward expansion, shot through with countless tales of heroism and 
			sacrifice, had steadily unfolded before the gaze of an astonished world; 
			and the end was not yet in sight.

      <span class="smcap">There</span> is no general history of the Northwest 
			covering the whole of the period dealt with in this book except Burke A. 
			Hinsdale, <i>The Old Northwest</i> (1888). This is a volume of substantial 
			scholarship, though it reflects but faintly the life and spirit of the 
			people. The nearest approach to a moving narrative is James K. Hosmer, 
			<i>Short History of the Mississippi Valley</i> (1901), which tells the 
			story of the Middle West from the earliest explorations to the close of 
			the nineteenth century, within a brief space, yet in a manner to arouse 
			the reader's interest and sympathy. A fuller and very readable narrative 
			to 1796 will be found in Charles Moore, <i>The Northwest under Three 
			Flags</i> (1900). Still more detailed, and enlivened by many contemporary 
			maps and plans, is Justin Winsor, <i>The Westward Movement</i> (1899), 
			covering the period from the pacification of 1763 to the close of the 
			eighteenth century. Frederick J. Turner, <i>Rise of the New West</i> 
			(1906) contains several interesting and authoritative chapters on
      western development after the War of 1812; and John B. McMaster, 
			<i>History of the People of the United States</i> (8 vols., 1883-1913), 
			gives in the fourth and fifth volumes a very good account of westward 
			migration.
    </p>
    <p>
      An excellent detailed account of the settlement and development of a
      single section of the Northwest is 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
			G.&nbsp;N. Fuller, <i>Economic and Social Beginnings of Michigan,</i> 
			Michigan Historical Publications, Univ. Series, No.&nbsp;1 (1916). A very 
			readable book is R.&nbsp;G. Thwaites, <i>The Story of Wisconsin</i> (rev. 
			ed., 1899), containing a full account of the early relations of white men 
			and red men, and of the Black Hawk War. Mention may be made, too, of 
			H.&nbsp;E. Legler, <i>Leading Events of Wisconsin History</i> (1898).
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the volumes dealing with the diplomatic history of the Northwest,
      mention should be made of two recent studies: C.&nbsp;W. Alvord, <i>The
      Mississippi Valley in British Politics</i> (2 vols., 1917), and E.&nbsp;S. 
			Corwin, <i>French Policy and the American Alliance</i> (1916).
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from Lincoln, few men of the earlier Northwest have been made the
      subjects of well-written biographies. Curiously, there are no modern
      biographies, good or bad, of George Rogers Clark, General St. Clair, or
      William Henry Harrison. John R. Spears, <i>Anthony Wayne</i> (1903) is an
      interesting book; and Andrew C. McLaughlin, <i>Lewis Cass</i> (1891), and 
			Allen Johnson, <i>Stephen A. Douglas</i> (1908) are excellent. Lives of 
			Lincoln that have importance for their portrayal of western society 
			include: John T. Morse, Jr., <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> (2 vols., 1893); 
			John G. Nicolay and John Hay, <i>Abraham Lincoln, a History</i> (10 vols., 
			1890); and Ida M. Tarbell, <i>Life of Abraham Lincoln</i> (new ed., 
			2 vols., 1917).
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will do well, however, to turn early to some of the works
      within the field which, by reason of their literary quality as well as
      their scholarly worth, have attained the dignity of classics. Foremost are
      the writings of Francis Parkman. Most of these, it is true, deal with the
      history of the American interior 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
			prior to 1763. But <i>Frontenac and New France under Louis XIV</i> 
			(Frontenac edition, 1915), and <i>A Half-Century of Conflict</i> (2 vols., 
			same ed.) furnish the necessary background; and <i>The Conspiracy of 
			Pontiac</i> (2 vols., same ed.) is indispensable. Parkman's work closes 
			with the Indian war following the Treaty of 1763. Theodore Roosevelt's 
			<i>Winning of the West</i> (4 vols., 1889-96) takes up the story at that 
			point and carries it to the collapse of the Burr intrigues during the
      second administration of Thomas Jefferson. This work was a pioneer in the
      field. In the light of recent scholarship it is subject to criticism at
      some points; but it is based on careful study of the sources, and for
      vividness and interest it has perhaps not been surpassed in American
      historical writing. A third extensive work is Archer B. Hulbert, 
			<i>Historic Highways of America</i> (16 vols., 1902-05). In writing the 
			history of the great land and water routes of trade and travel between 
			East and West the author found occasion to describe, in interesting 
			fashion, most phases of western life. The volumes most closely related to 
			the subject matter of the present book are: <i>Military Roads of the 
			Mississippi Valley</i> (VIII); <i>Waterways of Western Expansion</i> (IX); 
			<i>The Cumberland Road</i> (X); and <i>Pioneer Roads and Experiences of 
			Travellers</i> (XI-XII). Mention should be made also of Mr. Hulbert's 
			<i>The Ohio River, a Course of Empire</i> (1906).
    </p>
    <p>
      Further references will be found appended to the articles on Illinois,
      Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin in <i>The Encyclop&aelig;dia 
			Britannica</i> (11th edition).
    </p>
    <p>
      Opportunity to get the flavor of the period by reading contemporary
      literature is afforded by two principal kinds of books. One is
      reminiscences, letters, and 
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
			histories written by the Westerners themselves. Timothy Flint's 
			<i>Recollections of the Last Ten Years</i> (1826) will be found 
			interesting; as also J. Hall, <i>Letters from the West</i> (1828), 
			and T. Ford, <i>History of Illinois</i> (1854).
    </p>
    <p>
      The second type of materials is books of travel written by visitors from
      the East or from Europe. Works of this nature are always subject to
      limitations. Even when the author tries to be accurate and fair, his
      information is likely to be hastily gathered and incomplete and his
      judgments unsound. Between 1800 and 1840 the Northwest was visited,
      however, by many educated and fair-minded persons who wrote readable and
      trustworthy descriptions of what they saw and heard. A complete list
      cannot be given here, but some of the best of these books are: John
      Melish, <i>Travels in the United States of America in the Years 1806 &amp;
      1807 and 1809, 1810 &amp; 1811</i> (2 vols., 1812); William Cobbett, 
			<i>A Year's Residence in the United States of America</i> (1818); Henry B. 
			Fearon, <i>Sketches of America</i> (1818); Morris Birkbeck, <i>Letters 
			from Illinois</i> (1818); John Bradbury, <i>Travels in the Interior of
			America in the Years 1809, 1810, and 1811</i> (1819); Thomas Hulme, 
			<i>Journal made during a Tour in the Western Countries of America, 
			1818-1819</i> (1828); and Michael Chevalier, <i>Society, Manners, and 
			Politics in the United States</i> (1839). Copies of early editions of 
			some of these works will be found in most large libraries. But the reader 
			is happily not dependent on this resource. Almost all of the really 
			important books of the kind are reprinted, with introductions and 
			explanatory matter, in Reuben G. Thwaites, <i>Early Western Travels, 
			1748-1846</i> (32 vols., 1904-07), which is one of our chief collections 
			of historical materials.

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works to

<p class="bold">THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</p>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg&trade; License (available with this file or online at

<p class="bold double-space-top">
Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works</p>

<p>
1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>
1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>
1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade; works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg&trade; License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>
1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg&trade; work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>
1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>
1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg&trade; License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>
This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net.</p>

<p>
1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>
1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg &trade; License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

<p>
1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&trade;.</p>

<p>
1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg&trade; License.</p>

<p>
1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg&trade; web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>
1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&trade; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>
1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works provided
that</p>

<p>
   * You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg&trade; works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</p>

<p>
   * You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg &trade; works.</p>

<p>
   * You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</p>

<p>
   * You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade; works.</p>

<p>
1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>
1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg&trade;
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>
1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES: Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  <i>You agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict
liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those
provided in Paragraph F3.  You agree that the Foundation, the 
trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be 
liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or 
incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such
damage. </i>
</p>

<p>
1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND: If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>
1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', <em>with no other 
warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to 
warranties of merchantibility or fitness for any purpose.</em>
</p>

<p>
1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>
1.F.6.  INDEMNITY: You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg&trade;
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg&trade; work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<p class="bold double-space-top">
Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;</p>

<p>
Project Gutenberg &trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg's&trade;
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.</p>


<p class="bold double-space-top">

Foundation</p>

<p>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>

<p>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<em>send donations</em> or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org.</p>

<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate.</p>

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works.</p>

<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg&trade;
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
